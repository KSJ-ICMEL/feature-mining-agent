# LiCe(BH\_4)\_3Cl, a New Lithium-Ion Conductor and Hydrogen Storage Material with Isolated Tetranuclear Anionic Clusters

## ABSTRACT
Mechanochemical synthesis using $CeCl_3$-$MBH_4$ (M = Li, Na or K) mixtures are investigated and produced a new compound, $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$, which crystallizes in a cubic space group $I4_3m$, $a = 11.7204(2)\ \text{\AA}$. The structure contains isolated tetranuclear anionic clusters $[Ce_4Cl_4(BH_4)_{12}]^{-}$ with a distorted cubane $Ce_4Cl_4$ core, charge-balanced by $Li^+$ cations. Each Ce atom coordinates three chloride ions and three borohydride groups via the $\eta^3$-$BH_3$ faces, thus completing the coordination environment to an octahedron. Combination of synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD), powder neutron diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) optimization show that Li cations are disordered, occupying $2/3$ of the $12d$ Wyckoff site. DFT calculation indicates that $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ is stabilized by higher entropy rather than lower enthalpy, in accord with the disorder in Li positions. The structural model also agrees well with the very high lithium ion conductivity measured for $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ of $1 \times 10^{-4}\ \text{S cm}^{-1}$ at $T = 20\,^\circ\text{C}$. In situ SR-PXD reveals that the decomposition products consist of $LiCl$, $CeB_6$ and $CeH_2$. The Sieverts measurements show that $4.7\ \text{wt}\%$ $H_2$ is released during heating to $500\ ^\circ\text{C}$. After rehydrogenation at $400\ ^\circ\text{C}$ and $p(H_2) = 100\ \text{bar}$ for 24 h an amount of $1.8\ \text{wt}\%$ $H_2$ is released in the second dehydrogenation. The $^{11}$B MAS NMR spectra of the central and satellite transitions for $LiCe(B(D/H)_4)_3Cl$ reveal highly asymmetric manifolds of spinning sidebands from a single $^{11}$B site, reflecting dipolar couplings of the $^{11}$B nuclear spin with the paramagnetic electron spin of the $Ce^{3+}$ ions.

## INTRODUCTION
The transition toward a sustainable, environmentally friendly and carbon free energy system that can fulfill the increasing energy demands is considered one of the greatest challenges in the 21st century.1 In particular, a safe, compact, and efficient means of storage of renewable energy still remains to be identified. Chemical storage of energy as hydrogen or electricity in a battery is among the most promising approaches with a potential to reach the required high energy contents.2–4 This has prompted the present research project where a new lithium- and cerium-based borohydride chloride is prepared and characterized.

Hydrogen is abundant, easy to produce by electrolysis, and has the potential to be stored efficiently in the solid state, e.g., as metal borohydrides, which currently receive increasing interest. Unfortunately, many of the known borohydrides exhibit poor thermodynamic and kinetic properties, which hamper their utilization in technological applications.5–8 Therefore, significant focus has been on synthesis and characterization of novel bimetallic borohydrides because of their somewhat tunable decomposition temperatures.9–12 Furthermore, recent studies of metal borohydrides reveal a remarkable diversity in the structural topologies illustrated by a new nanoporous magnesium borohydride $\gamma$-$Mg(BH_4)_2$ with 33% empty volume.13 The compounds $Li_2Zn(BH_4)_5$ and $Na_2Zn(BH_4)_5$ are built from two identical interpenetrated three-dimensional frameworks consisting of isolated complex anions, $[Zn_2(BH_4)_5]^{-}$, whereas $NaZn(BH_4)_3$ consists of isolated anions of $[Zn(BH_4)_3]^{-}$ counter balanced by sodium.14,15 Isolated complex anions have also been observed in other structures, such as $[Sc(BH_4)_4]^{-}$ in $MSc(BH_4)_4$ (M = Li, Na or K) or $[Zn(BH_4)_2]^{-}$ in the heteroleptic borohydride, $KZn(BH_4)Cl_2$.16–20 Several of these mixed-metal borohydrides exhibit improved thermodynamic and kinetic properties, e.g., $LiSc(BH_4)_4$ and $NaSc(BH_4)_4$ are found to decompose in the temperature ranges 140 to $260\ ^\circ\text{C}$ and 167 to $267\ ^\circ\text{C}$, respectively.16–18 These are significantly lower temperatures as compared to the corresponding alkali borohydrides, $LiBH_4$ and $NaBH_4$, which decompose at approximately $380\ ^\circ\text{C}$ and $400\ ^\circ\text{C}$, respectively.21

The complex borohydride ion may resemble the halide ions in the solid state, which may facilitate anion substitution in metal borohydrides. The halide stabilized lithium borohydride

## EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Synthesis. The title compound was prepared from samples of $CeCl_3$–$LiBH_4$ in the molar ratios 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4, denoted samples s1–s3, s5 respectively (see Table 1). The samples were ball-milled (BM) in repeated sequences of 2 min BM and 2 min pauses for 60 repetitions using a Fritsch Pulverisette 4 planetary mill under inert conditions (argon atmosphere) in 80 mL tungsten carbide steel containers with tungsten carbide balls (d = 10 mm). The sample to balls mass ratio was approximately 1:35. Speeds of the main disk and of the planetary disks were 200 and 560 rpm, respectively.

A sample for neutron diffraction experiments was prepared from $CeCl_3$–$LiBD_4$ in molar ratio 1:3 (sample s4) using the same milling conditions as described above. Furthermore, samples of $CeCl_3$–MBH$_4$ (M=Na or K) in molar ratios 1:3 and 1:4 (samples s6–s9, respectively) were prepared by ball milling. The $CeCl_3$–KBH$_4$ samples (s8 and s9) were subjected to the same ball milling conditions as used for sample s1–s5. The $CeCl_3$–NaBH$_4$ samples (s6 and s7) were also initially ball milled using these conditions, however, as no reaction occurred, the samples were subsequently ball milled for additional 30 repetitions applying 2 min BM and 2 min pauses with speeds of the main disk and the planetary disks of 250 and 625 rpm, respectively.

All preparation and manipulation of the samples were performed in a glovebox with a circulation purifier maintained under an argon atmosphere with < 1 ppm of O$_2$ and H$_2$O. The chemicals used were anhydrous cerium chloride, $CeCl_3$ (Sigma-Aldrich 99.9%), lithium borohydride, $LiBH_4$ (Sigma-Aldrich, 95%), lithium borodeuteride, $LiBD_4$ (KatChem, 95%), sodium borohydride (Sigma-Aldrich, 95%) and potassium borohydride (Sigma-Aldrich, 95%). All chemicals were used as received.

Laboratory Powder X-ray Diffraction. All samples were initially investigated using laboratory powder X-ray diffraction (PXD) in order to identify the reaction products and estimate the crystallinity of the samples. PXD measurements were performed in Debye–Scherrer transmission geometry using a Stoe diffractometer equipped with a curved Ge(111) monochromator (Cu K$\alpha_1$ radiation, $\lambda = 1.54060\ \mathrm{\AA}$) and a curved position sensitive detector. Data were collected at RT from 4 to 127$^\circ$ $2\theta$ with counting times of $\sim$960 s per step. Air-sensitive samples were mounted in a glovebox in 0.5 mm glass capillaries sealed with glue.

In situ Synchrotron Radiation Powder X-ray Diffraction. In situ SR-PXD data was collected at the Swiss–Norwegian Beamlines (SNBL) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France. A glass capillary (o.d. 0.5 mm) containing the sample was heated from RT to 500 $^\circ\mathrm{C}$ at a rate of $8\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ while SR-PXD data were collected. The temperature was controlled with a Cyberstar hot air blower. The data were collected using a MAR345 image plate detector at a sample to detector distance of 250 mm, and a selected X-ray wavelength of $\lambda = 0.709637\ \mathrm{\AA}$. The capillary was oscillated $30^\circ$ during X-ray exposure of the sample for 30 s.

All obtained raw images were transformed to powder patterns using the FIT2D program, which was also used for calibration of the X-ray wavelength and the sample–detector distance using SR-PXD measurements of the standard NIST LaB$_6$ and masking diffraction spots from the single-crystal sapphire sample holder. Uncertainties of the integrated intensities were calculated at each $2\theta$ point by applying Poisson statistics to the intensity data, considering the geometry of the detector.

Powder Neutron Diffraction. The powder neutron diffraction (PND) experiment was conducted at the high-resolution powder neutron diffractometer HRPT at the spallation neutron source SINQ at Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland. The powder sample of ball milled $CeCl_3$–$Li^{11}BD_4$ (1:3, s4) was enclosed in a vanadium can (8 mm diameter), and data was collected with a neutron wavelength of $\lambda = 1.494\ \mathrm{\AA}$ in the high intensity mode using the standard ILL-type Orange cryostat at $-271$, $-248$, $-223$, and 25 $^\circ\mathrm{C}$.

Structure Solution of $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$. SR-PXD data collected at $\sim$160 $^\circ\mathrm{C}$ for $CeCl_3$–$LiBH_4$ (1:4, s4), containing the highest fraction of the new compound, was used for indexing and structure solution. Indexing of the diffraction peaks was performed using the program Dicvol in a body centered cubic cell ($a = 11.7204(2)\ \mathrm{\AA}$). The structure was solved in space group $I4\bar{3}m$ by global optimization in direct space using the program FOX, using one Ce, one Li, one Cl atom and a rigid tetrahedral $BH_4$ group as optimized units and a number of antibump restraints. The structure contains one cerium and one chloride atom located on the 8c Wyckoff site, while boron is located on the 24g Wyckoff site. The crystallographic positions of Ce, B, and Cl determined from PXD and PND, respectively, are similar. However, SR-PXD data alone showed some ambiguity for the Li positions. Therefore, the position was determined from the combination of SR-PXD, PND data and DFT optimization of the resulting models (discussed in more detail below). The only Li position consistent with the diffraction data and energy minimizations is the 12d Wyckoff site. The Li occupancy refines to ca. 2/3, corresponding to the expected 8 Li atoms per unit cell. A symmetry check in Platon did not suggest higher metric or crystallographic symmetry. According to the

multiplicity $Z = 8$, the crystallographic density for the $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ compound is $\rho = 1.87\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$.

The final Rietveld refinement was performed using the PND data measured at $-248\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ on $CeCl_3$–$Li^{11}BD_4$ (1:3, s4) and subsequently the SR-PXD data measured at $\sim160\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ on $CeCl_3$–$LiBH_4$ (1:4, s3).

using the program Fullprof,34 see Figure 1a and 1b. The background was described by linear interpolation between selected points. Due to an artifact SR-PXD data region $18.7$–$19.5^\circ\ 2\theta$ was omitted in the refinement. The final refinement on the SR-PXD data resulted in the following refinement factors, $R_p = 2.52\%$, $R_{wp} = 1.6\%$, $R_{exp} = 2.62\%$, $R_B = 3.32\%$ (not corrected for background) and $R_B = 5.1\%$, $R_{wp} = 5.98\%$ (corrected for background) and $\chi^2 = 3760$ (this value is high due to the very high counting statistics accumulated by the 2D detector). The refinement factors from the PND data are $R_B = 5.50\%$, $R_{wp} = 2.90\%$, $R_p = 2.67\%$, $R_{wp} = 3.55\%$ (not corrected for background) and $R_p = 9.43\%$, $R_{wp} = 10.4\%$ (corrected for background) and $\chi^2 = 3084$. The unit-cell parameter refines to $a = 11.4993(4)\ \mathrm{\AA}$ using the PND data. The strongest reflections has a less strong influence in the Rietveld refinements due to the used weighting scheme: $1/\sigma(I) = 1/(I)^{1/2}$.

However, the relative error is expected in average to be the same as for other peaks. There was no indication of any preferred orientation in the cubic structure. The atomic coordinates for $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ as found from the final refinement on SR-PXD and PND data are shown in Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information.

First-Principles Calculations. Several candidate structures derived from the PXD and PND data were examined by density functional theory calculations. The calculations were performed within the generalized-gradient approximation by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof35 as implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package.36 Projector augmented wave (PAW) potential with a plane-wave cutoff energy of $600\ \mathrm{eV}$ is used.37 For each atomic species, Li, Ce, B, H, and Cl, the PAW potentials $Li_{\mathrm{sv}}$, $Ce_3$, B, H, and Cl are used, respectively. Three valence electrons are included in the $Li_{\mathrm{sv}}$ potential, and a 4f electron in Ce is frozen to core in the $Ce_3$ potential.

A primitive cell having four formula units of $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ is used. Regular $k$-point meshes of $2\times2\times2$ in the first Brillouin zone including is $\Gamma$ point are sampled, which ensures energy convergence within $0.2\ \mathrm{meV/f.u.}$. Structural optimization was performed until the force on each atom became smaller than $0.005\ \mathrm{eV/\AA}$. During the optimization the lattice parameter was fixed to the experimental value from the SR-PXD analysis. Partial occupation at the 12d or 24g (discussed in detail below) sites is modeled in the DFT optimization by removing the 3-fold axes along the $\langle 111\rangle$ directions, which reduces the symmetry to the space group $I\overline{4}2m$ (see Figure S1a in the Supporting Information for the 12d model). The final atomic coordinates from the DFT optimization in the $I\overline{4}3m$ space group was derived by applying 3-fold rotation along $\langle 111\rangle$ to the 12d model (discussed in detail below).

Solid-State $^{11}$B MAS NMR Spectroscopy. Solid-state $^{11}\mathrm{B}$ MAS NMR spectra were obtained on Varian INOVA-400 (9.4 T) and Varian Direct-Drive VNMRS-600 (14.1 T) spectrometers using home-built $X$–$^{1}\mathrm{H}$ CP/MAS NMR probes for 5 mm and 4 mm o.d. rotors, respectively. The experiments used $^{11}\mathrm{B}$ rf field strengths of $\gamma_B B_1/2\pi = 52\ \mathrm{kHz}$ (9.4 T) and $\gamma_B B_1/2\pi = 60\ \mathrm{kHz}$ (14.1 T), 4 s relaxation delay, and $^{1}\mathrm{H}$ decoupling during acquisition ($\gamma_H B_1/2\pi \approx 45\ \mathrm{kHz}$ at both magnetic fields). The NMR experiments were performed at ambient temperature using airtight, end-capped zirconia rotors packed with the samples in a Ar-filled glovebox. The $^{11}\mathrm{B}$ isotropic chemical shifts are in ppm relative to $F_3B\cdot O(CH_2CH_3)_2$.

Conductivity Measurements. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using a BioLogic VMP3 potentiostat. Either steel disks (ion blocking) or lithium foils (nonblocking) were used as electrodes. Impedance (a.c.) spectra were recorded at RT between $1\ \mathrm{MHz}$ and $10\ \mathrm{mHz}$, with a voltage perturbation of $25\ \mathrm{mV}$. From the Nyquist plots of the complex impedance (imaginary part $Z_{\mathrm{im}}$ as a function of the real part $Z_{\mathrm{re}}$), the resistances of the samples were obtained from the diameter of the semicircle and from the intercept on the $Z_{\mathrm{re}}$ axis for $LiBH_4$ (reference sample) and $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$, respectively. The conductivity measurements were performed on five pellets made from sample $CeCl_3$–$LiBH_4$ (1:3, s5). The pellets with a diameter of $10\ \mathrm{mm}$ and with thicknesses in the range $0.5$ to $2.0\ \mathrm{mm}$ were prepared by using a uniaxial press ($900\ \mathrm{MPa}$). Sintering of the pellets was performed at RT due to possible decomposition of the materials at elevated temperatures. The pellets densities were ca. $2.42\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$, which corresponds to a compactness of $93\%$, calculated using the density of sample $CeCl_3$–$LiBH_4$ (1:3, s5) derived from the Rietveld refined composition, $\rho(\mathrm{S5}) = 2.61\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$.

Thermal Analysis and Sievert Measurements. The samples $CeCl_3$–$LiBH_4$ (1:3, s2) and (1:4, s3) were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Sievert’s measurements. Simultaneous TGA and DSC were performed using a Netzsch STA449C Jupiter instrument in the temperature range RT to $500\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ ($\Delta T/\Delta t = 10\,^\circ\mathrm{C/min}$) using corundum crucibles with lid as sample holder. The experiments were conducted in helium (4.6) atmosphere.

The cyclic reversibility of hydrogen release and uptake was studied by Sievert’s measurements using a PCTPro 2000 apparatus.38,39 Three

desorption and two absorption cycles were measured for ca. 150 mg of material. Hydrogen desorption data was collected during heating from $RT$ to $500\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$ ($\Delta T/\Delta t = 1\ ^\circ\mathrm{C/min}$) and then keeping the temperature constant at $500\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$ for 3 h with a back pressure of $p(H_2) = 1\ \mathrm{bar}$. Hydrogen absorption measurements was performed before the second and third desorption cycle at $400\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and $p(H_2) = 100\ \mathrm{bar}$ for 24 h.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

### Synthesis and Initial Phase Analysis.

Lithium cerium borohydride chloride, $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ was synthesized by a mechano-chemistry, i.e. ball milling (BM) of samples $CeCl_3$–$LiBH_4$ (1:3, s2) and (1:4, s3). The SR-PXD data, collected at $RT$ after BM, show diffraction peaks from $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$, $LiCl$, and $CeCl_3$, indicating that the reaction shown in (1) occurs.

$$
CeCl_3 + 3LiBH_4 \rightarrow LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl + 2LiCl \tag{1}
$$

The gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density for $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ is $\rho_m = 5.37\ \mathrm{wt\%}\ H_2$ and $\rho_v = 99.8\ \mathrm{kg\ H_2/m^3}$, respectively. The reaction between $CeCl_3$ and $LiBH_4$ is a complex reaction, which is believed to be a coupled metathesis and addition reaction leading to the formation of $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ and $LiCl$. The optimal stoichiometry between reactants according to reaction 1 is $1:3$. However, the reaction is not completed using the selected ball milling conditions, as unreacted $CeCl_3$ is identified by PXD.

Upon heating, the reaction between $CeCl_3$ and $LiBH_4$ continues from 100 to $160\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$, where the maximum amount of $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ is observed by SR-PXD. The composition of s3 at $160\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$ found by Rietveld refinement is $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ 62 wt\% (32 mol \%), $LiCl$ 22 wt\% (61 mol \%), and $CeCl_3$ 16 wt\% (7 mol \%). s4 used for the PND experiment and $^{11}B$ MAS NMR analysis was also analyzed with SR-PXD measured at RT, and the overall sample composition was $LiCe(^{11}BD_4)_3Cl$ 66 wt\% (28 mol \%), $LiCl$ 29 wt\% (70 mol \%) and $CeCl_3$ 5 wt\% (2 mol \%), which indicates that reaction 1 has occurred to a higher extent during BM for this sample. Crystalline lithium borohydride is not observed in the synthesis products for any of the samples by SR-PXD or PND. However, $LiBH_4$ was confirmed to be present in an amorphous state by NMR analysis (see below). Prolonged ball milling times or conditions facilitating higher energy during ball milling are possibly needed to complete reaction 1. The samples $CeCl_3$–$NaBH_4$ and $CeCl_3$–$KBH_4$ were treated at similar mechano-chemical conditions as compared to the $CeCl_3$–$LiBH_4$ samples but no indications for chemical reaction were observed.

### Crystal Structure of $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$.

$LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ crystallizes in a cubic unit cell, $a = 11.7204(2)\ \mathrm{\AA}$, with space group symmetry $I\bar{4}3m$. The positions of $Ce$, $B$ and $Cl$ ions were readily determined from the SR-PXD data. The structure contains isolated tetranuclear anionic clusters of $[Ce_4Cl_4(BH_4)_{12}]^{4-}$ with a distorted cubane $Ce_4Cl_4$ core, charge-balanced by $Li^+$ cations. Rietveld refinement of the PND data measured at $-248\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$ reveal a $\eta^3$–$BD_3$–$Ce$ coordination mode. The angles $\angle Cl$–$Ce$–$Cl$ and $\angle B$–$Ce$–$B$ are $73.26(16)^\circ$ and $99.2(6)^\circ$, respectively, and the $Ce$–$Cl$ and $Ce$–$B$ distances are $2.961(6)\ \mathrm{\AA}$ and $2.742(2)\ \mathrm{\AA}$, respectively. From the initial SR-PXD structural analysis some ambiguity existed concerning the position of the $Li^+$ ions and several structural models were investigated by Rietveld refinement of SR-PXD data and PND data and by DFT optimization, revealing that $Li^+$ ions are disordered, occupying $2/3$ of the $12d$ Wyckoff site. $Li^+$ ions coordinate tetrahedrally to four $BD_4^{-}$ groups via the tetrahedral edge, i.e., $\eta^2$–$BD_2$–$Li$.

Three B–D distances are determined to be $1.181(8)\ \mathrm{\AA}$ (D1), $1.22(1)\ \mathrm{\AA}$ (D2) and $1.231(7)\ \mathrm{\AA}$ (D3). The closest D\(\cdots\)D contact is $1.9302(82)\ \mathrm{\AA}$ (D1–D3).

As mentioned, a combined analysis of data from SR-PXD, PND and DFT optimization was utilized to locate the $Li^+$ ions. Besides the structure of $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ described above with $Li^+$ positioned on the $12d$ Wyckoff site two other $Li^+$ positions were considered but eventually rejected. One of these two models corresponds to the only possible fully ordered arrangement of $Li^+$ ions on the sites $2a$ and $6b$. The $2a$ site is situated in the center of the distorted cubane cage $Ce_4Cl_4$, resulting in $Ce$–$Li$ distance of only $2.8757(14)\ \mathrm{\AA}$. For comparison, in a similar mixed metal borohydride chloride $NaY(BH_4)_2Cl$ the shortest $Na$–$Y$ distance is $4.95\ \mathrm{\AA}$. Indeed, DFT calculations on a model with the $2a$ site filled by $Li^+$ ions shows larger discrepancy for the position of $Ce$ atoms with respect to the experimental data. Moreover, a Rietveld refinement of the PND data measured at $-248\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$ revealed that the model with $Li^+$ on the $12d$ site gave the best fit to the experimental data.

(Additional discussion continues beyond the visible portion of the page.)

|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| $12d$ | 2.52 | 5.50 | 0 | $2/3$ |
| $2a,\,6b$ | 3.38 | 6.96 | 0.42 | 1 (for both sites) |
| $24g$ | 2.51 | 5.19 | 1.14 | $1/3$ |

$a$ Not corrected for background.  
$b$ Energy is calculated with respect to the lowest energy structure.

refinement of the occupancy for the $2a$ site gives a negative value of $-0.8$ using the SR-PXD data, questioning the credibility of the model.

In the third structural model for $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$, one-third of the $24g$ site ($x = 0.12350,\, z = 0.57580$) is occupied by Li$^+$ ions. However, DFT optimization showed large displacements of lithium and in particular hydrogen atom positions yielding a model inconsistent with neutron diffraction data. The Rietveld refinement using the SR-PXD data reveal unacceptably short Li–H distances of $\sim 1.2\ {\AA}$. Because of the lack of agreement between the theoretical and experimental data the third model was also rejected.

DFT optimization showed that the $12d$ model (see Figure S1a in the Supporting Information) has the lowest energy and that the $2a/6b$ and the $24g$ model energies are higher by $0.42$ and $1.14\ \mathrm{eV/f.u.}$, respectively. Furthermore, the optimized (center of the cage)–Ce distance for the $12d$ and $2a$ model are $2.905$ and $3.114\ {\AA}$, respectively. This difference makes a noticeable change in the simulated X-ray diffraction patterns since the heaviest atom Ce most strongly scatters X-rays and the $12d$ model reproduces the experimental pattern more closely (see the R-values in Table 2). DFT optimization reveals that relaxation of the unit cell volume leads to a rather large expansion of $11.1\%$ while accompanying a small decrease in energy by $0.051\ \mathrm{eV/f.u.}$ for the model containing the $2a$ site. Contrary to that, the model with $12d$ site remains stable, with only $0.1\%$ variation of the cell parameter and the related total energy changes of less than $1\ \mathrm{meV/f.u.}$. Another ordered variant of Li$^+$ configuration in the $12d$ site was modeled using DFT (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), which has higher energy by only $0.028\ \mathrm{eV/f.u.}$ and almost constant unit cell volume within $0.6\%$ of the experimental value. The similarities in energy and volume between different hypothetically ordered $12d$ sites strongly support this model.

The formation energy for $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ from LiCl and $Ce(BH_4)_3$ has also been estimated using DFT calculations. Since the crystal structure of $Ce(BH_4)_3$ is unknown, the low temperature polymorph of $Y(BH_4)_3$ was adopted as a hypothetical ``$Ce(BH_4)_3$'' structure. Both LiCl and $Ce(BH_4)_3$ were simulated with the same approximations as $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$. The DFT optimized lattice parameter for ``$Ce(BH_4)_3$'' is $a = 11.482\ {\AA}$, which is somewhat larger than that of $Y(BH_4)_3$ ($a = 10.852\ {\AA}$) and rather close to that observed for $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ ($a = 11.720\ {\AA}$, this study), reflecting the relatively larger ionic radius of Ce and weaker binding as compared to $Y(BH_4)_3$. This may partly explain why formation of $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ is preferred to the formation of ``$Ce(BH_4)_3$'' under the same experimental condition. The reaction energy for (2) is estimated to be slightly endothermic.

$$
\mathrm{LiCl} + \mathrm{Ce(BH_4)_3} \rightarrow \mathrm{LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl} \quad \Delta E = 13.9\ \mathrm{kJ/mol}\ ( \mathrm{or}\ 0.144\ \mathrm{eV})
$$

Temperature effects are not taken into account and $\Delta E$ is the DFT total energy difference. Since the bonding characters are largely preserved between the reactants and the product, $\Delta H$ ($T = 298\ \mathrm{K}$) would not be significantly different from $\Delta E$ ($T = 0\ \mathrm{K}$). Therefore, the structure of $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ may be stabilized by higher entropy rather than lower enthalpy, and this result again favors the $12d$ model because disorder in Li positions would certainly contribute to the entropy.

In this study, a bimetallic borohydride chloride $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ is discovered, in contrast to other rare earth metal borohydrides produced mechano-chemically from similar metalborohydride–metalchloride reaction mixtures, i.e., $LiSc(BH_4)_3$, $Y(BH_4)_3$, and $Gd(BH_4)_3$. This dissimilarity might be due to differences in ionic radii (given in parentheses) for the lanthanides as compared to lithium, i.e. $Li^+$ ($0.76\ {\AA}$) $\approx$ $Sc^{3+}$ ($0.75\ {\AA}$) $<$ $Y^{3+}$ ($0.90\ {\AA}$) $<$ $Gd^{3+}$ ($0.94\ {\AA}$) $<$ $Ce^{3+}$ ($1.02\ {\AA}$). Apparently, anionic structures are preferred for the smallest ions, as in $LiSc(BH_4)_4$, and formation of monometallic framework structures seems to be more favorable for the slightly larger lanthanides, e.g., $Y(BH_4)_3$ and $Gd(BH_4)_3$. The largest lanthanides appear to facilitate formation of more complex framework structures, as for $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$, which contains isolated tetranuclear anionic clusters $[Ce_4Cl_4(BH_4)_{12}]^{4-}$ with a distorted cubane $Ce_4Cl_4$ core, charge-balanced by Li$^+$ cations.

Solid-State $^{11}$B MAS NMR. The $^{11}$B MAS NMR spectra of the central and satellite transitions for the deuterated sample $CeCl_3$–$Li^{11}BD_4$ (1:4, s4) recorded at $14.1\ \mathrm{T}$ and $9.4\ \mathrm{T}$ reveal manifolds of spinning side bands (ssb) from a single $^{11}$B site, in agreement with the present crystal-structure determination. The appearance of the ssb manifolds in the three spectra is highly asymmetric and thereby deviates from the symmetric ssb patterns reported earlier for the $^{11}$B central and satellite transitions in borohydride compounds. Although asymmetries in the ssb intensities from the central and satellite transitions may arise from the combined effect of the $^{11}$B quadrupole coupling and chemical shift anisotropy interactions, as demonstrated in $^{11}$B MAS NMR spectra of borates, the asymmetry in the present spectra reflects strong $^{11}$B nuclear spin – paramagnetic electron-spin dipolar interactions, present along with the $^{11}$B quadrupole coupling. Thus, the $^{11}$B nuclear spin couples to the surrounding free electrons of the paramagnetic $Ce^{3+}$ ions, in accordance with cerium present as the $Ce^{3+}$ ion in $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$, i.e., the $Ce^{4+}$ ion would result in a diamagnetic compound. In addition to the asymmetry of the ssb manifolds, these couplings also result in a significant line broadening of the individual ssbs. The fact, that the individual $^{11}$B spins couple to the paramagnetic electron from several $Ce^{3+}$ ions in different distances to the $^{11}$B site and that these couplings are additive, prevents a straightforward simulation of the ssb manifolds by consideration of the mutual effects from the $^{11}$B quadrupole coupling and $^{11}$B nuclear spin — paramagnetic electron-spin dipolar couplings. However, the observation of these heteronuclear dipolar couplings strongly suggests that the paramagnetic electron is localized in a $Ce^{3+}$ bonding and that it is nonconducting. It is unlikely that the well-defined $^{11}$B MAS NMR spectra shown in Figure 4 could have observed if the unpaired electrons were conducting. An estimation of the $^{11}$B quadrupole coupling constant ($C_Q$) can

be achieved from the width of the ssb manifolds, which equals $C_Q$ for a spin $I = 3/2$, assuming that the width is dominated by the first-order quadrupole interaction for the satellite transitions.54 The $^{11}B$ MAS NMR spectra in Figure 4 are shown on identical widths in Hz, demonstrating that this is an acceptable approximation, and resulting in the estimated quadrupole coupling of $C_Q = 420\ \mathrm{kHz}$. This value is of the same magnitude as earlier reported $^{11}B$ quadrupole couplings for $BH_4^{-}$ ($BD_4^{-}$) sites in borohydrides.19,47,50 Moreover, apparent $^{11}B$ isotropic chemical shifts of $\delta_{\mathrm{iso}} = 26.8\ \mathrm{ppm}$ and $\delta_{\mathrm{iso}} = 26.1\ \mathrm{ppm}$ are determined54 from the spectra recorded at 14.1 and 9.4 T, respectively, assuming $C_Q = 420\ \mathrm{kHz}$ and an axially symmetric quadrupole coupling tensor ($\eta_Q = 0$). Although these values are nearly identical, the apparent chemical shift for $LiCe(BD_4)_3Cl$ in s4 is significantly shifted to high frequency as compared to the $^{11}B$ chemical shift range observed for $BD_4^{-}$ sites in diamagnetic borohydrides (e.g., roughly from $-35$ to $-47\ \mathrm{ppm}$). This high-frequency shift may reflect that the $^{11}B$ spin–paramagnetic electron-spin interactions also contribute with a Knight shift of the $^{11}B$ resonance. $^{11}B$ MAS NMR spectra have also been acquired for the hydrogen samples, i.e. $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ in s1–s3 (not shown), which reveal the same centerband ($\delta = 26\ \mathrm{ppm}$) and ssb manifold as observed for the deuterated sample along with a centerband resonance at $\delta_{\mathrm{iso}} = -41.2\ \mathrm{ppm}$ and a few associated ssbs from $LiBH_4$ in the samples. $LiBD_4$ is also observed in the s4 sample, as most clearly seen in the 9.4 T spectrum recorded with a spinning speed of $\nu_R = 12.0\ \mathrm{kHz}$. However, evaluation of the intensities for the two compounds in this spectrum gives the intensity ratio $I(\mathrm{LiBD}_4):I(LiCe(BD_4)_3Cl) = 0.03$, demonstrating that the amount of $LiBD_4$ is very small in the s4 sample.

Lithium Ion Conductivity. Conductivities are measured for $LiBH_4$ (Sigma-Aldrich, as received) and $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ (sample CeCl$_3$–LiBH$_4$ 1:3, s5) pellets between steel disks acting as ionically blocking electrodes by impedance spectroscopy, at $T = 20\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$. The impedance spectra recorded for $LiBH_4$ is shown in the Supporting Information. From the diameter of the semicircle observed at high frequency, which is related to the lithium ion mobility, a resistance of $R = 8.35 \times 10^{5}\ \Omega$ is measured for a 0.56 mm pellet thickness. This leads to a conductivity of $8.6 \times 10^{-8}\ \mathrm{S\ cm}^{-1}$ at $20\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ in good agreement with the values reported for orthorhombic $\alpha$-$LiBH_4$.55 No signature of the electrode interface or the grain boundaries are observed on the impedance spectra.

For $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$, impedance spectra were recorded on pellets of different thicknesses and the impedances are much lower than that of $\alpha$-$LiBH_4$ in all cases. Only Warburg impedances related to the semi-infinite diffusion at the electrodes are observed and frequencies higher than $1\ \mathrm{MHz}$ are needed to fully plot the semicircles assigned to the lithium ion mobility in the material. Nevertheless, the shape of the impedance spectra is typical of a good conductor and the conductivity can be calculated from the intercept with the real axis ($Z_{\mathrm{re}}$ value). A linear relationship is revealed for $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ between the resistance and the pellet thickness.

The extrapolated resistance for a zero thickness is very low ($R_o = 42\ \Omega$) highlighting the quality of our electrode-material interface. The slope of the linear fit is $R = 1232\ \Omega\ \mathrm{mm^{-1}}$ hence for a 10 mm diameter pellet a conductivity of $1.03\times 10^{-4}\ \mathrm{S\ cm^{-1}}$ is determined. The conductivity of the $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ sample $CeCl_3$–$LiBH_4$ (1:3, s5) is therefore about 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of $\alpha$-$LiBH_4$ at RT and is similar to that found for the hexagonal $h$-$LiBH_4$–$LiI$ solid solution.25,56,57

Note that the $CeCl_3$–$LiBH_4$ (1:3, s5) sample is not a single phase: the sample composition determined by Rietveld refinement is $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ 49 wt% (6 mol%), $LiCl$ 17 wt% (84 mol%), and $CeCl_3$ 34 wt% (10 mol%). Nevertheless, as the conductivities of solid-state $LiCl$ and $CeCl_3$ are very low at RT, the measured ionic conductivity undoubtedly originates from the $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ compound. The volume fraction of $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ in the $CeCl_3$–$LiBH_4$ (1:3, s5) sample is actually high (82%) and a percolation phenomenon occurs giving a high ionic conductivity to the pellet. Needless to say that a single-phase $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ pellet should lead to higher conductivity values and that synthesis efforts are currently in progress in our laboratories.

To investigate more in detail the nature of the conduction, we also carried impedance spectroscopy out on a pellet sandwiched between lithium foils acting as ion nonblocking electrodes. The resistivity is given for both the measurements made between steel disks and between lithium foils. The resistivity is similar in the case of the metallic lithium electrodes and the shape of the impedance curve resembles a curve for a good conductor. From the intercept with the real axis, a conductivity of $7\times 10^{-5}\ \mathrm{S\ cm^{-1}}$ is obtained at $20\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$. This suggests that the $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ sample $CeCl_3$–$LiBH_4$ (1:3, s5) is a good lithium ion conductor. The high lithium ion conductivity in $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ may be attributed to empty Li positions in the structure. According to the structural model for $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$, only $2/3$ of the Li positions (12d Wyckoff site) are occupied in a disordered manner. These first conductivity measurements suggest that $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ could be considered as a future candidate for a solid electrolyte in the next-generation lithium-ion batteries. Recently, extremely high Li ion conductivity of $1.2\times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{S\ cm^{-1}}$ was reported for the novel compound $Li_{10}GeP_2S_{12}$.58 $^7$Li NMR experiments are in progress to demonstrate the high $Li^+$ mobility and to definitively conclude that the ionic conductivity originates solely from $Li^+$ cations.

Thermal Analysis and Sievert Measurements.

Thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements for samples $CeCl_3$–$LiBH_4$ (1:3, s2) and (1:4, s3) are shown in Supporting Information, Figure S3, and Figure S8, respectively. Sample s3 show a mass loss of 0.7 wt% in the temperature range RT to $500\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$ (heating rate $\Delta T/\Delta t = 10\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ in He flow) in the temperature range $150$ to $240\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and a larger loss in the range $240$ to $290\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$ of $3.0\ \mathrm{wt\%}$. Thus, the observed mass loss for sample s3 is $3.7\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ in the temperature range RT to $500\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$, which is less than the calculated hydrogen content of the sample, $4.84\ \mathrm{wt\%}\ H_2$. The observed and calculated mass losses for sample s2 are $3.2$ and $3.88\ \mathrm{wt\%}\ H_2$, respectively. Considering that the decomposed samples contain cerium dihydride, $CeH_2$, the calculated hydrogen contents of the samples s2 and s3 are $3.23$ and $4.23\ \mathrm{wt\%}\ H_2$.

The DSC data for s3 show two small endothermic peaks at $93$ and $109\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$, which may correspond to the onset temperature for the reaction between remaining $CeCl_3$ and $LiBH_4$ in the sample (see reaction scheme 1) and to the polymorphic phase transition from orthorhombic to hexagonal $LiBH_4$. An endothermic peak observed at $213\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$ may correspond to the melting of $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$. A smaller

endothermic event observed at $240^\circ\mathrm{C}$ may be associated with the initial decomposition of $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$. Indeed, the decomposition may consist of multiple reactions visible as shoulders at $257$ and $261^\circ\mathrm{C}$ at the major DSC signal with peak value at $266^\circ\mathrm{C}$. The endothermic events at $213$ and $266^\circ\mathrm{C}$ are correlated with the mass loss observed in the TGA data.

Reversible hydrogen storage properties were investigated using Sieverts measurements for sample s3 and s2 and the data is shown in Figure 9 and the Supporting Information, Figure S4, respectively. The sample s3 contains one equivalent excess $LiBH_4$, which may be rehydrogenated and the calculated hydrogen release from a sample s3 containing $CeH_2$ and $1$ equiv. of $LiBH_4$ is $2.12\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ H_2$. In contrast, sample s2 releases $3.75\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ H_2$ in the first cycle (d1) and $1.25$ and $1.25\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ H_2$ in the second and third cycles, which is comparable to the calculated $H_2$ release of $3.88$ and $0.97\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ H_2$ assuming that s2 contains $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ prior to d1 and $CeH_3$ for the later desorption cycles (see the Supporting Information, Figure S4). The decomposition products for s3 after the third desorption (d3) in the Sieverts measurements were investigated by Rietveld refinement of SR-PXD data. Diffraction from the decomposition products $LiCl$, $CeH_2$, and $CeB_6$ are identified along with an unknown compound.

Desorption data for sample s3 is collected in the Supporting Information, Table S3. Sample s3 releases $0.5\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ H_2$ from $RT$ to $220^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and a major $H_2$ release of $3.25\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ H_2$ is observed from $220$ to $270^\circ\mathrm{C}$, which corresponds to the observations by TGA and DSC. Additionally, $0.80\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ H_2$ is released during heating from $270$ to $500^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and $0.15\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ H_2$ is released after heating the samples for $3\ \mathrm{h}$ at a constant temperature of $500^\circ\mathrm{C}$. Hence, the total observed $H_2$ release is $4.7\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ H_2$ for sample s3. In a previous study of the $CeCl_3$–$LiBH_4$ system gas analysis revealed a very small amount of diboran during hydrogen desorption. In the present study, the mass loss from the samples are all below the theoretical content of hydrogen; for this reason, the release of diboran from the samples is assumed to be at a minimum.

The Sieverts measurements for the second (d2) and third (d3) desorption follow a different trend since only $0.25\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ H_2$ is released in the temperature range $RT$ to $270^\circ\mathrm{C}$. In contrast, desorptions d2 and d3 release $1.25$ and $1.15\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ H_2$ from $270$ to $500^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and $0.5$ and $0.4\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ H_2$ during $3\ \mathrm{h}$ at a constant temperature of $500^\circ\mathrm{C}$. Thus, the desorption d2 and d3 does not show the expected hydrogen release in the temperature range $RT$ to $270^\circ\mathrm{C}$ for the decomposition of $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ revealing that the sample is not fully rehydrogenated at the selected conditions for hydrogen absorption. In total, the desorption d2 and d3 release $2.0$ and $1.8\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ H_2$, which is slightly higher than the calculated hydrogen content assuming that $CeH_2$ or $CeH_3$ is formed during absorption of sample s3, i.e., $0.60$ or $0.91\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ H_2$, respectively.

Decomposition Mechanism for $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ Observed by In situ SR-PXD

The thermal decomposition of samples $CeCl_3$–$LiBH_4$ (1:3, s3) and (1:4, s4) were studied by in situ SR-PXD. Both samples display similar decomposition mechanism, though the decomposition products from s2 appear more crystalline and are discussed in the following. The first SR-PXD patterns in the series measured at $RT$ show diffraction peaks from $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$, $CeCl_3$ and $LiCl$. The diffraction peaks from $CeCl_3$ decrease slowly at $T > 63^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and disappear at $315^\circ\mathrm{C}$. During heating from $100$ to $160^\circ\mathrm{C}$ the amounts of $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ and $LiCl$ increase, while that of $CeCl_3$ decreases because of the progress of reaction 1. The Bragg diffraction peaks from $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ disappear at $240^\circ\mathrm{C}$, possibly because of melting and subsequent decomposition and diffraction from an unknown compound appear at $240^\circ\mathrm{C}$. Peaks from $CeH_2$ emerge at $320^\circ\mathrm{C}$ when $CeCl_3$ disappears. The unknown compound may be a ternary salt composed of lithium, cerium and chloride and remains in the sample during the rest of the heating. A ternary salt, $NaYCl_4$, is also observed during the decomposition of $NaY(BH_4)_4Cl_2$. Structural determination of the unknown compound has unfortunately not been possible, but further studies are currently being performed to elucidate the atomic composition. The reaction scheme (3) describes the idealized overall decomposition reaction for s2 omitting the unknown compound.

## CONCLUSION

The novel compound $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ crystallizes in the cubic crystal system with the space group $I\bar{4}3m$ and the structure contains isolated tetranuclear anionic clusters $[Ce_4Cl_4(BH_4)_{12}]^{4-}$ with a distorted cubane $Ce_4Cl_4$ core charge-balanced by $Li^+$ cations. The $Li^+$ ions are disordered and occupy $2/3$ of the $12d$ Wyckoff sites. The structural model was derived by the combined use of synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD), powder neutron diffraction (PND), and density functional theory (DFT) and would likely not have been obtained with any combination of only two of the methods. DFT indicates that $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ is stabilized by higher entropy rather than lower enthalpy, in accord with the disorder at the Li positions. The structural model and DFT calculations agree well with the very high lithium ion conductivity measured for the $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ containing sample, $1.03\times10^{-4}\ \mathrm{S\ cm^{-1}}$ at $T = 20\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$. Conductivity measurements carried out between lithium foils suggest that the conductivity mainly originates from the high lithium ion mobility, which is in favor of our model of disordered Li. Solid-state $^{11}\mathrm{B}$ MAS NMR spectra of the central and satellite transitions reveal that the $^{11}\mathrm{B}$ spin interacts with the paramagnetic electron-spins (from the unpaired electron on $Ce^{3+}$), which also contribute with a Knight shift of the $^{11}\mathrm{B}$ resonance. Very high lithium ion conductivity is in favor of our structural model including disordered Li. The new compound $LiCe(BH_4)_3Cl$ also stores $5.33\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ hydrogen, which is released in the temperature range $220$–$260\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$. Rehydrogenation at moderate conditions leads to a reversible storage capacity of only $\sim 1\ \mathrm{wt}\%\ H_2$.
