Rechargeable all-solid-state lithium Li-ion batteries (AS-LIBs)
are attractive power sources for electrochemical applications;
due to their potentiality in improving safety and stability over
conventional batteries with liquid electrolytes. AS-LIBs require
a Li-fast ion conductor (FIC) as the solid electrolyte. Finding a
solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and compatibility
with other battery components is a key factor in building high
performance AS-LIBs. There have been numerous studies, e.g.,
on lithium rich sulﬁde glasses as solid electrolytes. However,
the limited current density remains a major obstacle in
developing competitive batteries based on the known solid
electrolytes. Here we prepare argyrodite-type Li6PS5X (X ¼ Cl,
Br, I) using mechanical milling followed by annealing. XRD
characterization reveals the formation and growth of Li6PS5X
crystals in samples under varying annealing conditions. For
Li6PS5Cl an ionic conductivity of the order of 104 S/cm is
reached at room temperature, which is close to the Li mobilityin
conventional liquid electrolytes (LiPF6 in various carbonates)
and well suitable for AS-LIBs.

1 Introduction Rechargeable all-solid-state lithium
or Li-ion batteries (AS-LIBs) are attractive power sources
for applications like ‘‘smart’’ credit cards and medical
implants. They need a Li-fast ion conductor (FIC) as the solid
electrolyte. The purpose is to improve safety and stability
over conventional batteries with liquid electrolyte. Finding a
suitable solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity is a
pivotal issue for building practical solid-state batteries.
There have been numerous developments on materials such
as lithium rich sulﬁde glasses as solid electrolyte. However,
limited current density remains a major impediment in these
electrolyte systems.
Argyrodites form a class of chalcogenide structures
related to the mineral Ag8GeS6, which includes various fast
Agþ or Cuþ ion conductors such as A7PS5X (A ¼ Agþ, Cuþ)
[1]. Recently, Deiseroth et al. [2] could synthesize the
analogue cubic Liþ argyrodytes with formula Li6PS5X
(X ¼ Cl, Br, I) and Li7PS6.
7Li-NMR relaxation and
impedance experiments ﬁnd an intrinsic local lithium
mobility of the Li-argyrodite crystals as high as 102–
103 S/cm at room temperature close to the mobility in liquid
With such high lithium mobilities, these materials may be
ideal for use as solid electrolytes in lithium ion batteries.
Here we prepare the argyrodite-type Li6PS5X (X ¼ Cl, Br)
using mechanical milling followed by annealing of the
samples. XRD and impedance measurements of the samples
are reported here.
Ion transport studies for the silver and copper thiopho-
sphates can be based on the detailed available anharmonic
structure reﬁnements; no comparably detailed studies are so
far available for the Lithium compounds due to the low
scattering power of Li and phase transitions preventing low-
temperature single crystal studies. Therefore we analyze the
ion transport pathways in the Li6PS5X (X ¼ Cl, Br) phases
using optimized empirical force-ﬁelds in combination with
the bond valence analysis of energy landscapes for the
mobile Liþ.
2 Experimental method Li6PS5X (X ¼ Cl, Br, I)
samples were prepared by high energy mechanical milling
using Agate (45 ml pot and 15 number of 10 mm ø ball) pot
and balls; Li2S, P2S5, and LiX (X ¼ Cl, Br, I) crystalline

ground for 20 h followed by annealing at 550 8C for 5 h.
Samples were pressed into 10 mm diameter pellets of
1.5 mm thick for annealing the samples. All the procedure
was done under Ar atmosphere. The annealed samples were
characterized by X-ray powder diffractometry using Cu Ka
radiation (PANalytical X’Pert PRO) equipped with a fast
linear detector. XRD data were collected in the 2u8 range 8–
1008 with a nominal scan rate of 120 s step-1 and a step size
of 0.0168 at room temperature. Rietveld reﬁnements of XRD
powder patterns were performed with the generalized
structure analysis system (GSAS) by Larson and von
Dreele [3], along with the graphical user interface EXGUI
[4]. Structure data from published from single crystal X-ray
data measurements by Deiseroth et al. [2]. The structures
were thus reﬁned based on the same set of 49 reﬁnable
parameters: 12 background variables of shifted Chebyshev
function, 7 proﬁle variables, 1 cell parameter, 24 reﬁnable
atomic coordinates, 3 atomic displacement parameters, 1
preferential orientation parameter and an overall scale factor.
Ionic conductivity measurements of ball milled and ﬁnal
samples at different temperatures were carried out by
impedance spectroscopy (Schlumberger Solartron SI1260)
in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 10 MHz. Stainless steel
plates were used as electrodes. At each temperature the
samples were kept for 20 min for thermal equilibration. The
bulk resistance Rb was determined from ﬁtting impedance
data to Nyquist plots. The equivalent circuit consists of Cb,
Rb, and a Warburg element.
3 Bond valence approach Empirical relationships
between bond length R and bond valence S are widely used in
crystal chemistry to identify plausible equilibrium sites for
an atom in a structure as sites where the BV sum of the atom
matches its oxidation state,
SLi-X ¼ exp ðR0RÞ
b


:
(1)
A systematic adjustment of BV parameters b to the bond
softness, together with the inclusion of interactions beyond
the ﬁrst coordination shell permits more adequate estimates
of non-equilibrium site bond valences. The modeling of
pathways for mobile Liþ as regions of low site energy E(Li)
(or of low bond valence sum mismatch jDV(Li)j) has been
demonstrated to be a simple and reliable way of identifying
transport pathways in local structure models, provided that
the local structure model captures the essential structural
features. While bond valences sLi-S ¼ exp[(R0  RLi-S)/b]
and hence the BV sum mismatch jDVj are mostly expressed
in arbitrary ‘‘valence units,’’ they may – as we have shown
recently [5–11] – also be linked to an absolute energy scale
by expressing the bond valence as a Morse-type interaction
energy:

Here, srel equals s/smin and smin represents the value of the
bond valence for the equilibrium distance Rmin, which is
estimated from the bond valence parameter R0 and typical
coordination number NC of the cation (for details see
Ref. [9]). Pathways for Liþ can then be modeled as regions
in the structure as described in our previous reports [10].
These pathways are visualized as regions enclosed by
isosurfaces of constant E(Li) based on a grid of E(Li)
values with a resolution &lt;0.1 A˚ covering the unit cell.
The threshold value of E(Li) for which the E(Li) isosurfaces
form a continuous migration pathway (that includes
both occupied and vacant Li sites), permits a rough
estimate of the activation energy for the Liþ ion transport
process. As such an approach neglects relaxation, the
assessment of the activation energy is based on an empirical
correlation observed for a wide range of Lithium ion
conductors.
4 Results and discussion The XRD patterns of ball
milled samples showed partial crystallinity with peaks
belonging to the Li2S, P2S5, and LiX (X ¼ Cl, Br, I) phases.
While for the samples that have been ball-milled for 24 h,
peaks of various phases are still rather prominent; peaks of
most phases except Li2S become very broad after 24 h. After
annealing both samples yield the respective argyrodite
phases with comparable crystallinity. Thus preparation time
for argyrodites could be drastically reduced when compared
to the original synthesis recipe [2], where the preparation
takes 7 days. Figure 1 shows the Rietveld ﬁt to the ﬁnal
Li6PS5I system.
The ﬁnal samples of Li6PS5Cl, Li6PS5Br, and Li6PS5I
exhibit the high symmetry aristotype of the argyrodite
structure in space group F-43m (see Fig. 1). The lattice
parameters of Li6PS5Cl, Li6PS5Br, and Li6PS5I are 9.850(4),
9.980(8) and 10.142(3) A˚ , respectively. These values are in
good agreement with the reported values. SEM images of
both samples showed the formation of about 100 nm nano
crystals for Li6PS5Br. SEM of the ball milled sample before

Low
temperature ionic conductivity studies to determine the
activation energy of the crystalline compounds are in
progress in our laboratory.

Roughly speaking, the three-dimensional pathway net-
work for long range (dc) ion conduction in all Li6PS5X
phases consist of interconnected low-energy local pathway
cages.
In detail however these cages and the way in which they
are interconnected differs for the compounds with different

halide ions. In the structure of Li6PS5Cl structure (l.h.s.
column in Fig. 2) the sites of lowest energy agree with the
experimentally reﬁned half-occupied Li1 positions. The
lowest energy short range pathway then interconnects three
such partially occupied Li sites via three interstitial sites
forming a pathway hexagon (EA ¼ 0.18 eV). Four such
hexagons are then interconnected at a slightly higher energy
threshold via a second interstitial site to form an extended
pathway cage around the nominal Cl position (EA ¼ 0.22 eV)
and the 3D long range pathway network is ﬁnally
established by a direct connection in-between the cages
(EA ¼ 0.35 eV).
For the case of Li6PS5I however, experimental studies
suggest a more disordered Li distribution described in Ref.
[2] by Li1–Li2–Li1 triplet sites. In our bond valence model
the sites of lowest E(Li) accordingly imply a disordered Li
distribution over the Li1 sites only. The lowest energy
interconnection between sites then includes the Li2 site in-
between pairs of Li1 sites (0.09 eV), but the Li2 position
appears not to be a local minimum of E(Li), which is also in
line with the difference Fourier plot shown in Ref. [11].
Experimental NMR data ﬁnd an even lower activation
energy of 0.043 eV for unspeciﬁed local hops [2]. Six of
these dumbbell-like local pathways (which correspond to the
intercage pathways in Li6PS5I) then form a pathway cage
around the S2 site (not as in the previous case around the
halide ion) with EA ¼ 0.15 eV. The cages are ﬁnally
interconnected via an interstitial site for EA ¼ 0.33 eV in
remarkable agreement with the experimental value 0.32 eV
from low temperature impedance spectroscopy and 0.30 eV
from MD simulations. MD simulations also suggest 0.14 eV
for a localized motion. [11].
The characteristics of Liþ pathways in Li6PS5Br appear
to mix features of pathways in the cases X ¼ Cl and X ¼ I
cases. Again, there is a clear disorder over Li1 sites (The
experimental structure determination again suggests a Li1-
Li2-Li1 triplet). The lowest energy local pathway inter-
connecting these sites is a hexagon of three Li1 and three
interstitial sites as in Li6PS5Cl (EA ¼ 0.15 eV). The local
pathway cage forms as in Li6PS5I around the S2 site (the site
is effectively occupied by 84% S/16% Br according to Ref.
[11]) for EA ¼ 0.25 eV, but only at a minutely lower energy
than for the long range pathways (EA ¼ 0.27 eV), which may
be thought of as a combination of cages around S2 and
around the halide site (which again is occupied by a mixture
of Br and S). Preliminary neutron data point toward a similar
anion disorder for Li6PS5Cl. It should also be kept in mind
that the bond valence model of Li6PS5Br may be less
accurate, as it is based on the experimental structure
determination of a crystal that had a slightly lower Br
content and a disorder of S and Br over the S2/Br2 and Br3/
S3 sites.
It might be noteworthy that analogous oxide argyrodites
Li6PO5X (X ¼ Cl, Br) have also been reported recently [12].
Due to the different position of oxide ion O2 in these from
the S2 position in Li6PS5X pathway cages and long range
pathways found for the oxide argyrodites differ fundamen-
tally. From the signiﬁcantly higher activation energies found
in bond valence models for local (0.4 eV) and long range
pathways (0.57 eV) in Li6PO5Cl, and the absence of
interstitial sites in these pathways it can be understood why
the oxide analogues show an oders of magnitude lower
conductivity (109 S/cm at ambient temperature, exper-
imental activation energy 0.66 eV).
5 Conclusions Li6PS5X (X ¼ Cl, Br) argyrodite struc-
tures were prepared by mechanical milling followed by
annealing of the samples. This allows for a faster synthesis
than the earlier reported long annealing. The obtained
crystalline phase showed ionic conductivity of the order of
103 S/cm at ambient temperature for argyrodites exhibiting
anion disorder (X ¼ Cl, Br). Bond valence based Liþ ion
migration pathways for both compounds yield pathways
with similarly low activation energies for long range
transport (ca. 0.3 eV), despite the pronounced differences
in the pathway topology for different halide ions. It could be
clariﬁed that the even lower activation energies reported
from NMR studies refer to hops within extended local
pathway cages that are not directly relevant for the dc
conductivity. Due to the high ionic conductivity of the
compounds at room temperature, these compounds are of
high technological interest as one of the best solid electrolytes
for high energy all solid state battery applications.

With such high lithium mobilities, these materials may be
ideal for use as solid electrolytes in lithium ion batteries
Here we prepare the argyrodite-type Li6PS5X (X ¼ Cl, Br
using mechanical milling followed by annealing of the
samples. XRD and impedance measurements of the sample
are reported here.
Ion transport studies for the silver and copper thiopho
sphates can be based on the detailed available anharmonic
structure refinements; no comparably detailed studies are so
far available for the Lithium compounds due to the low
scattering power of Li and phase transitions preventing low
temperature single crystal studies. Therefore we analyze the
ion transport pathways in the Li6PS5X (X ¼ Cl, Br) phase
using optimized empirical force-fields in combination with
the bond valence analysis of energy landscapes for the
mobile Li [þ] .

4 Results and discussion The XRD patterns of ba
milled samples showed partial crystallinity with pea
belonging to the Li2S, P2S5, and LiX (X ¼ Cl, Br, I) phase
While for the samples that have been ball-milled for 24
peaks of various phases are still rather prominent; peaks
most phases except Li2S become very broad after 24 h. Aft
annealing both samples yield the respective argyrodi
phases with comparable crystallinity. Thus preparation tim
for argyrodites could be drastically reduced when compar
to the original synthesis recipe [2], where the preparatio
takes 7 days. Figure 1 shows the Rietveld fit to the fin
Li6PS5I system.
The final samples of Li6PS5Cl, Li6PS5Br, and Li6PS
exhibit the high symmetry aristotype of the argyrodi
structure in space group F-43m (see Fig. 1). The latti
parameters of Li6PS5Cl, Li6PS5Br, and Li6PS5I are 9.850(4
9.980(8) and 10.142(3) A [˚ ], respectively. These values are
good agreement with the reported values. SEM images

Li6PO5Br and Li6PO5Cl: The first Lithium-Oxide-Argyrodites

Abstract. The title compounds Li6PO5Br (F4¯3m, a = 8.297(1) Å, Z = 4)
and Li6PO5Cl (F4¯3m, a = 8.2234(9) Å, Z = 4) represent the first oxidic
argyrodites in general and the first lithiumoxoargyrodites in particular.
The overall crystal structure corresponds to the cubic high temperature
(HT) modification of all known cubic argyrodites, however, with a
seemingly small but important difference concerning the lithium posi-
tions. In all other HT argyrodites with similar lithium content the 24
lithium atoms per unit cell are disordered over a 48 fold position in
close vicinity to a 24 fold one causing a high mobility of the Li+. In
the title compounds, however, they occupy the 24 fold one in a strictly
ordered manner thus establishing a planar triangular first sphere coor-
Introduction
The rare mineral Ag8GeS6 [1] is representative for a growing
group of solids named “argyrodites”. Many if not all of them
appear in a high temperature (HT) and a low temperature (LT)
modification. In these compounds, which are available by suit-
able solid state synthesis methods, the highly mobile Ag+ can
be replaced by Cu+ and other not necessarily monovalent cati-
ons [2]. A substitution of germanium by group 13 or 15 ele-
ments (e.g. Ga or P) or a substitution of one chalcogen atom
per formula unit by a halide atom results in a different number
of the mobile cations (e.g. γ-Cu7PSe6 [3] or Ag9GaSe6 [4]).
With Li7PCh6, Li7–δPCh6–δXδ (Ch: S, Se; X: Cl, Br, I; δ ≤1)
and Li6AsCh5I (Ch: S, Se) we recently published the first argy-
rodites in which Ag(Cu) is completely replaced by lithium [5–
7]. The high mobility of lithium in these compounds extends
over a broad temperature range and was proven by MAS-NMR
spectroscopy [8, 9] and conductivity measurements. The title
compounds presented in this paper are the first oxygen based
argyrodites. This unusual argyrodite variant was not known up
to now neither as mineral nor as synthetic solid. With respect

dination environment. This detail is of great importance for the amount
of the specific lithium ionic conductivity and for the possible phase
transition to an LT (low temperature) modification accompanied by an
ordering of the disordered lithium atoms. Apparently the latter transi-
tion is suppressed in the title compounds because the Li+ are already
frozen out in the cubic (HT = LT) form. The initially open question
how this structural peculiarity influences the ionic conductivity
(strengthening or weakening in comparison to oxygen free argyrod-
ites?) is answered by a series of impedance measurements. The specific
lithium ionic conductivity of the title compounds in the range 313 K
&lt; T &lt; 518 K is significantly lower than in oxygen free argyrodites.
to potential practical applications of lithium argyrodites as
solid electrolytes in rechargeable batteries [10, 11] the possibil-
ity to replace the more or less toxic chalcogen atoms by oxy-
gen is highly interesting. The crystal structure of the title com-
pounds has been refined on the basis of X-ray single crystal
and powder data. In this paper we report the essential aspects
of the crystal structure of these new compounds and compare
them with other argyrodites without repeating overviews that
have been published recently [5, 6, 8]. Furthermore, we try to
rationalize the structural properties on the background of the
generally accepted Frank–Kasper model of “tetrahedral close
packing” and finally we present values for the specific lithium
ionic conductivity in the temperature range between 313 and
518 K based on impedance measurements.
Results and Discussion
A summary of relevant X-ray single crystal data and intera-
tomic distances for Li6PO5Br and Li6PO5Cl measured at T =
293 K for both compounds and at 573 K for the bromide com-
pound is given in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. The unit cell
of the cubic title compounds that emphasizes the isolated PO4
3–
groups and one characteristic coordination polyhedron of Li+
is shown in Figure 1. Although the new compounds crystallize
in space group F4¯3m like all other high temperature phases of
argyrodites, they show a significant structural difference to the
latter ones concerning the crystallographic positions of the 24
lithium atoms per unit cell (see below).

From a general view the title compounds can be rationalized
as normal valence oxide halide phosphates (Li+)6(PO4)3–O2–X–
(X = Cl, Br). As already discussed for other lithium argyrodites
like Li7PS6 [8] and Li6PS5I [6] the simple ionic description
gives no deeper insight into the crystal chemical background
of argyrodites and their chemical and physical properties. In-

stead a rationalization based on the Frank–Kasper model [12]
of tetrahedral close packing is more fruitful. Such a description
implies (similar to all other non-oxygen argyrodites) that the
oxygen–halogen partial structure is topologically equivalent to
the structure of Mg and Cu in the cubic Laves phase MgCu2
[13]. Thus it constitutes a cubic structure matrix consisting of
a three-dimensional arrangement of distorted tetrahedra formed
by oxygen and halogen atoms. These tetrahedra are intimately
connected by common corners edges and faces. In this frame-
work the phosphorus atoms occupy tetrahedral holes in a regu-
lar way forming isolated PO4
3– groups. One oxygen atom and
one halogen atom per formula unit are not directly coordinated
to phosphorus. In all lithium argyrodites investigated up to
now the spatial distribution of the Li+ changes reversibly from

at lower temperatures (LT phase, order-disorder transition).
Surprisingly the title compounds are the first lithium argyrodite
examples where the Li+ are ordered in the whole accessible
temperature range (173 K &lt; T &lt; 873 K). They occupy well
defined positions in the tetrahedral framework of single O2–,
Br– (or Cl–) atoms and PO4
3– groups (Figure 1) and conse-
quently no HT/LT phase transition is observed. The particular
lithium position 24g, which is important for a deeper under-
standing of the crystal structure, defines a trigonal bipyramidal
3+2 coordination (face shared double tetrahedra) for the lith-
ium atoms. In the bromide compound three O2– are at distances
of 1.97 Å (O1, 2 × ) and 1.92 Å (O2,) and two Br– at a dis-
tance of 2.94 Å. The Li–O distances are slightly smaller and
the Li–Br distance slightly longer than those found in the Li-
bromide-oxides Li3OBr [octahedral coordination of Li, 2 × O
(2.02 Å) and 4 × Br (2.85 Å, [14])] and Li7O2Br3 [octahedral
coordination of Li, 1 × O (2.01 Å) and 5 × Br (2.85 Å) or 2 ×
O (2.02 Å) and 4 × Br 2.85 Å, [14])].
The single crystal measurement for the bromide carried out
at 573 K shows no significant structural differences in compar-
ison to the RT measurement except a normal thermal expan-
sion for all structural data. For the chloride compound the
smaller lattice constants also induce smaller Li–O1 distances
(Table 3). The P–O distances are similar in both compounds.
sible temperature range 173 K &lt; T &lt; 873 K. Thus a HT/LT
transition as in all other argyrodites is missing. In order to
make this seemingly unusual behavior of the title compounds
more plausible one has to be aware of the different lithium
content of halide free and halide containing argyrodites with
group 15 elements, e.g. the difference between Li7PO6 (hypo-
thetic, corresponding to Li7PS6 [8]) and Li6PO5X (title com-
pounds). This is important because all known argyrodites re-
gardless of the number of lithium atoms per formula unit
crystallize in the same HT structure type, based on space group
F4¯3m with Z = 4 with 28 (“Li7PO6”) or 24 disordered lithium
atoms (Li6PO5X) per unit cell. The latter is favored because in
all such structures the delocalized electron density correspond-
ing to the disordered lithium atoms is smeared over an ex-
tended space around the Wyckoff position 24g (Figure 1). Al-
ternatively it can be described by a nearby split position (48h)
[6]. In any case, 24 marks the upper limit for the number of
lithium atoms in or near the crystallographic position 24g,
which is in particular favored by crystal chemical arguments
[6]. Thus, the four “excess” lithium atoms in argyrodites of the
type Li7PS6 have to occupy less suitable positions in the struc-
ture. There is some experimental experience (e.g. preferred
crystallization, fast formation of single phase samples) that the
composition type Li6PCh5X (Ch: O, S, Se, X: Cl, Br, I) is easier
accessible than alternative ones with more or less lithium per
formula unit. An additional difference between argyrodites
with HT/LT transition (e.g. Li6PS5I) and those ones without
HT/LT transition (title compounds) is the specific crystal
chemical situation around the 24g position. For Li6PS5I (and
other argyrodites of this composition type) the distance be-
tween lithium in 24g and I (corresponding to Br in Figure 1)
is unusually long (~3.6 Å, [6], expected for r(Li+) + r(I–)
(CN = 6) according to [15]: ~2.95 Å). Because there is no
closer cationic neighbor for I–, it seems “undercoordinated”.
This unfavorable situation is relaxed upon the HT/LT transi-
tion, because only 12 of 24 lithium atoms in LT-Li6PS5I are
frozen out on the “ideal” trigonal 24g position (with too long
d(Li–I!)). The remaining twelve Li+ ions occupy tetrahedral
positions away from the trigonal plane with significantly
shorter d(Li–I) (3,02 Å) [6]. Such an “asymmetric” ordering is
observed for the phase transitions of all other known silver-
and copper argyrodites based on the optimal composition with
6 M atoms. Because the Li–Cl- or Li–Br distances (2,91 Å and
2,93 Å) in the title compounds with all Li+ ions in 24g corre-
spond to expected values no order-disorder transition is re-
quired and consequently not observed. A comparison between
a section of the electron density around the Li+ ion in 24g/
48h Wyckoff position for HT-Li6PS5I and Li6PO5Br (Figure 2)
confirms the difference in the spatial distribution of disordered
and ordered lithium atoms.
Concerning the lithium ionic conductivity of oxide based ar-
gyrodites in comparison to those ones based on S/Se, one has
to be aware that the lattice constants of the latter ones (cubic,
HT) amount to about 10 Å whereas the lattice constants of the
oxide argyrodites amount to ~ 8 Å only. This implies a denser
packing of the O/X atoms (oxygen/halogen: 2.5 Å &lt; d(O–O/X)

&lt; 3 Å) that define the tetrahedral close packing in comparison
to the respective S/Se-atoms (3.3 Å &lt; d(S–S) &lt; 4.1 Å). Due to
the more narrow diffusion channels one would expect a lower
mobility of Li+ in the oxide argyrodite. Figure 3 shows the
total conductivity based on a series of temperature dependent
impedance measurements for samples of Li6PO5Cl between
313 K and 518 K. Using titanium electrodes the appearance of
a Warburg response in the low frequency region (Figure 4) for
the ionically blocking cell arrangement indicates that Li6PO5Cl
is predominantly an ionic conductor. The capacity derived
from the peak frequency of the high frequency semi-circle is
about 5 to 10 pF and indicate clearly bulk processes (corre-
sponding dielectric constants are about 15–35). As expected
the conductivity is low and increases from ~ 10–9 S·cm–1 at
ambient temperature to ~10–6 S·cm–1 at 518 K. This is less by
2–3 orders of magnitude than for S/Se argyrodites [16]. The
activation energy of 0.66 eV of Li6PO5Cl is also significantly
higher than S/Se argyrodites (~ 0.33 eV).

Experimental Section
Synthesis
Li6PO5Cl and Li6PO5Br were synthesized starting from stoichiometric
amounts of Li3PO4 (99+ %, Chempur), Li2O (99.5 %, Alfa-Aesar) and
LiCl (99.99 %, Chempur) or LiBr (99.99 %, Alfa-Aesar). The starting
materials were homogenized, pressed to pellets and transferred into a
gold crucible, which was placed in a quartz ampoule. A reaction in
carbon coated quartz glass ampoules results in less homogeneous pro-
ducts. All experiments were carried out in an argon-filled glovebox
(O2 &lt; 1 ppm, H2O &lt; 1 ppm) and the starting materials and hardware
(mortar, pressing tool, ampoules etc.) were carefully dried at T ~ 593
K–720 K (ampoules). The evacuated quartz glass ampoules were an-
nealed for 120 h at 723 K. After the reaction, the ampoules were slowly
cooled to room temperature. The colorless and hygroscopic products
were handled in a glovebox. The absence of OH in the samples was
checked by Raman spectroscopy. This is indispensable because OH-

are easily formed with traces of water.
Powder X-ray Analysis
X-ray powder patterns were measured with a Siemens D5000 diffrac-
tometer with Cu-Kα radiation (Ge monochromator). The hygroscopic
samples were grounded and measured between two Mylar foils (diame-
ter of 0.01 mm) sealed with grease. Li3PO4 was detected as minor
crystalline impurities. For high-temperature investigations the pow-
dered samples were measured in quartz capillaries.
Crystal Structure Determination
For single crystal measurements the respective crystal was transferred
into a glass capillary which was sealed under inert conditions. The
glass capillary was mounted on a STOE IPDS I imaging plate diffrac-
tion system. The data were collected in the f-scan mode using graphite
monochromatized Mo-Kα radiation (graphite monochromator) at room
temperature. Data analysis and evaluation was carried out with the
STOE IPDS program package [18]. For the structure solution (direct
methods) and refinement the programs SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97
[19] were used. A summary of crystal and experimental data as well
as structure refinement details for both compounds are given in Table 1
and Table 2. Further details of the crystal structure investigations may
be obtained from the Fachinformationszentrum Karlsruhe, 76344 Eg-

421479 (Li6PO5Cl), CSD-421480 (Li6PO5Br, T = 293 K) and CSD-
421481 (Li6PO5Br 573 K).
Impedance Measurements
Polycrystalline pellets of the argyrodites were prepared in a glove box
(O2 ≤0.1 ppm, H2O = ≤0.3 ppm) by applying a monoaxial pressure
of 1.24 kbar onto carefully grinded samples using a stainless steel
pressing tool (typical sample thickness: 1 mm, typical diameter 6 mm).
Impedance measurements were carried out in an argon atmosphere in
an air tight quartz tube with a High Resolution Dielectric Analyzer
(Novocontrol) in the frequency range of 106 Hz–10–1 Hz. A symmetric
cell Ti/Li6PO5X/Ti with titanium foil as ionically blocking electrodes
was used, and measurements were performed in the temperature range
313–518 K with steps of 20 K for the heating and cooling cycle. The
impedance spectra were evaluated using the software ZVIEW [20].

of the specific lithium ionic conductivity and for the possible pha
transition to an LT (low temperature) modification accompanied by
ordering of the disordered lithium atoms. Apparently the latter tran
tion is suppressed in the title compounds because the Li [+] are alrea

to potential practical applications of lithium argyrodites
solid electrolytes in rechargeable batteries [10, 11] the possib
ity to replace the more or less toxic chalcogen atoms by ox
gen is highly interesting. The crystal structure of the title com
pounds has been refined on the basis of X-ray single crys
and powder data. In this paper we report the essential aspec
of the crystal structure of these new compounds and compa
them with other argyrodites without repeating overviews th
have been published recently [5, 6, 8]. Furthermore, we try
rationalize the structural properties on the background of t
generally accepted _Frank_ - _Kasper_ model of “tetrahedral clo
packing” and finally we present values for the specific lithiu
ionic conductivity in the temperature range between 313 a
518 K based on impedance measurements.

latter ones concerning the crystallographic positions of the

ngly the title compounds are the first lithium argyrodite

positions in the tetrahedral framework of single O [2–],
Cl [–] ) atoms and PO43– groups (Figure 1) and conseno HT/LT phase transition is observed. The particular
position 24 _g_, which is important for a deeper underof the crystal structure, defines a trigonal bipyramidal

As stated above there is no indication for disorder in the acce
sible temperature range 173 K &lt; _T_ &lt; 873 K. Thus a HT/L
transition as in all other argyrodites is missing. In order
make this seemingly unusual behavior of the title compoun
more plausible one has to be aware of the different lithiu
content of halide free and halide containing argyrodites w
group 15 elements, e.g. the difference between Li7PO6 (hyp
thetic, corresponding to Li7PS6 [8]) and Li6PO5 _X_ (title com
pounds). This is important because _all_ known argyrodites _r_
_gardless_ of the number of lithium atoms per formula u
crystallize in the _same_ HT structure type, based on space gro
_F_ 4 [¯] 3 _m_ with _Z_ = 4 with 28 (“Li7PO6”) or 24 disordered lithiu
atoms (Li6PO5 _X_ ) per unit cell. The latter is favored because
all such structures the delocalized electron density correspon
ing to the disordered lithium atoms is smeared over an e
tended space around the Wyckoff position 24 _g_ (Figure 1). A
ternatively it can be described by a nearby split position (48

[6]. In any case, 24 marks the upper limit for the number
lithium atoms in or near the crystallographic position 24
which is in particular favored by crystal chemical argumen

[6]. Thus, the four “excess” lithium atoms in argyrodites of t
type Li7PS6 have to occupy less suitable positions in the stru
ture. There is some experimental experience (e.g. preferr
crystallization, fast formation of single phase samples) that t
composition type Li6P _Ch_ 5 _X_ ( _Ch_ : O, S, Se, _X_ : Cl, Br, I) is eas
accessible than alternative ones with more or less lithium p
formula unit. An additional difference between argyrodit
_with_ HT/LT transition (e.g. Li6PS5I) and those ones _witho_
HT/LT transition (title compounds) is the specific crys
chemical situation around the 24 _g_ position. For Li6PS5I (a
other argyrodites of this composition type) the distance b
tween lithium in 24 _g_ and I (corresponding to Br in Figure
is unusually long (~3.6 Å, [6], expected for _r_ (Li [+] ) + _r_ (
(CN = 6) according to [15]: ~2.95 Å). Because there is
closer cationic neighbor for I [–], it seems “undercoordinated
This unfavorable situation is relaxed upon the HT/LT tran
tion, because only 12 of 24 lithium atoms in LT-Li6PS5I a
frozen out on the “ideal” trigonal 24 _g_ position (with too lo

positions away from the trigonal plane with significan
shorter _d_ (Li–I) (3,02 Å) [6]. Such an “asymmetric” ordering

The novel lithium-ion conductor Li7Ge3PS12 was synthesized by slow cooling from the ternary Li2S–GeS2–P2S5
system, and was shown to exhibit a cubic argyrodite-type structure. The phase composition was determined by
varying the ratio of starting materials; the observed monophasic properties were close to those for the
Li7Ge3PS12 composition. The lattice parameter (a =9.80192(3) Å) of Li7Ge3PS12 was slightly smaller than that
of Li7PS6 (a =9.993 Å), indicating that substitution of a Li cation by the smaller Ge cation contracted the cubic
lattice. In addition, the novel structure consisted of a framework composed of four isolated (Ge/P)S4 tetrahedra.
Li+ ions occupied tetrahedral sites within the framework, forming a three-dimensional conduction pathway.
Finally, Li7Ge3PS12 exhibited a high ionic conductivity of 1.1×10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C and an activation energy of
25 kJ mol−1.
1. Introduction
Lithium-ion conductors are of great interest for use as solid
electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries, as they have the potential to allow
operation under signiﬁcantly more severe conditions than those
suitable for current battery systems [1,2]. In particular, the develop-
ment of stable and non-ﬂammable electrolytes could improve battery
reliability, with solid electrolytes being promising candidates for this
purpose. However, a number of issues remain, including the search for
novel solid electrolytes exhibiting high lithium-ion conductivity com-
bined with high electrochemical and chemical stabilities [2–5]. Thus,
the discovery and development of new lithium-ion conducting solids is
important to provide additional materials for all-solid-state battery
systems.
One example of a crystalline superionic conductor is Li10GeP2S12,
which exhibits an extremely high lithium-ion conductivity of 1.2×10−2
S cm−1 at 27 °C and a high electrochemical stability &gt; 5 V versus
lithium [1]. This material exists in the Li2S–GeS2–P2S5 system, which
also includes a number of other lithium-ion conductors with high ionic
conductivities. Examples include Li4GeS4–Li3PS4 solid solutions with
the LISICON-type structure [6,7], Li7PS6 with the argyrodite-type
structure [8,9], and Li7P3S11 glass ceramics [10]. Indeed, previous
reports have indicated that this quasi-ternary system could provide
various novel materials exhibiting high lithium-ion conducting char-
acteristics, with a number of materials potentially remaining unex-
plored.
Among the various ionic conductors reported to date, materials
exhibiting an argyrodite-type structure can be considered interesting
candidates because they allow anion/cation substitution in their crystal
structure [11]. The term argyrodite is derived from the mineral
Ag8GeS6. Various atomic substitutions in the structure of this mineral
have provided a wide range of argyrodite-type materials suitable for the
ionic conduction of monovalent cations, including Ag+ and Cu+[12,13].
However, to date, only a few argyrodite-type materials had been
reported as lithium-ion conductors in the anion/cation substituted
Li7PS6 system. For example, halogen-substituted compounds such as
Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) have cubic argyrodite-type structures and
exhibit a lithium-ion conductivity of 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature
[14,15]. The argyrodite structure consists of 136 tetrahedral sites in a
unit cell, including four isolated PS4 tetrahedra in a tetrahedrally close-
packed anion array, in which 24 lithium ions occupy sites within the
remaining 132 empty tetrahedral sites [11]. This distribution of lithium
ions, which contributes to ionic diﬀusion, is characteristic of the
argyrodite structure.
Thus, we herein report the development of a novel lithium-ion
conducting crystalline material, focusing on the ternary Li2S–GeS2–
P2S5 system, examining a previously un-synthesized composition. A
systematic materials search will be carried out to identify any novel
crystalline materials, and the relationship between structure and ionic
conductivity will be investigated.

2. Materials and methods
The starting materials, Li2S (99.9%, Nippon Chemical Industrial
Co. Ltd.), GeS2 ( &gt; 99.99%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co. Ltd.),
and P2S5 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), were mixed in the appropriate molar
ratios (see Table 1) in an Ar-ﬁlled glovebox. All mixtures were
pelletized, placed into carbon-coated quartz glass tubes, and sealed in
a ~10 Pa vacuum. The samples were then heated at 870 °C for 8 h in a
furnace and cooled slowly to 28 °C. The reaction products were
characterized by powder X-ray diﬀraction under an argon atmosphere
using a Rigaku SmartLab powder X-ray diﬀractometer with Cu Kα
radiation (45 kV, 200 mA). The diﬀraction data were collected at 25 °C
in a 2θ range of 10–120° with a step width of 0.01°.
The synchrotron X-ray diﬀraction pattern of the powdered sample
was obtained at 25 °C using a Debye-Scherrer camera with an imaging
plate at the BL02B2 beam line, at a wavelength of 0.6 Å. All measure-
ments were carried out at the SPring-8 facility. Synchrotron X-ray
diﬀraction data were analyzed using the Rietveld method and the
RIETAN-FP package [16].
Ionic conductivity was determined using an alternating current (ac)
impedance method in the frequency range of 1–1 MHz using a
Solartron 1260 frequency response analyzer. A disk-shaped sample
material (~570 °C). Gold paste electrodes were coated on the surfaces
of the disk prior to heating under vacuum at 150 °C for 3 h. The data
were collected under a ﬂow of Ar gas between 25 and 105 °C.
Diﬀerential thermal analysis (DTA) was performed using a Rigaku
Thermo Plus TG 8120 system between 24 and 900 °C for the sample
sealed in an evacuated quartz ampule.
The charge and discharge characteristics of the all-solid-state
battery were examined using Li7Ge3PS12 as a solid electrolyte. The
positive and negative electrodes were composed of a mixture of
LiNbO3-coated LiCoO2 and Li-In metal (thicknesses: 0.3 mm (Li)
and 0.1 mm (In), diameters: 10 mm (Li and In)) [17]. The electro-
chemical properties of the cell were determined using a TOSCAT-3100
battery analyzer (Toyo System Co. Ltd.). A cycling test was carried out
between 1.9 and 3.6 V (vs. Li-In: ~0.6 V vs. Li/Li+) at an applied
current of 7.25 mA g−1 at 25 °C.
3. Results and discussion
A materials search for lithium-ion conductors was carried out using
the formation diagram of the quasi-ternary Li2S–GeS2–P2S5 system,
which is depicted in Fig. 1. In this system, intermediate crystalline
compounds, such as Li3PS4 (thio-LISICON structure) [18], Li7PS6
(argyrodite structure) [9], and Li7P3S11[10] exist in the Li2S–P2S5 tie
line, while Li4GeS4[19–22] and the Li10GeP2S12-type Li4–kGe1–kPkS4
solid-solution exist in the Li3PS4–Li4GeS4 tie line [1,7,23]. Although
other compositions have also been reported [24,25], large regions of
the diagram remain unexamined. Table 1 summarizes the composi-
tions synthesized herein along with the phase identiﬁcation results
obtained from X-ray diﬀraction measurements. For clarity, all compo-
sitions are numbered consistently throughout Figs. 1 and 2. A number
of X-ray diﬀraction patterns of the materials synthesized in the ternary
system are provided in Fig. 2, which shows that the observed phases
were indexed as GeS2, Li4P2S6, Li3PS4, and Li4GeS4, together with
peaks corresponding to the new argyrodite phase. Speciﬁc analysis
close to the region of formation of the new phase indicated that this
novel phase could be generated with a nominal composition close to
that of Li7Ge3PS12 (see composition number 9 in Table 1).
Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diﬀraction patterns of both Li7Ge3PS12 and
the cubic high-temperature modiﬁcation of Li7PS6 with the F-43m
space group (no. 216) (ICSD no. 421130) exhibiting an argyrodite-type
structure. The two diﬀraction patterns are similar, indicating that the
novel Li7Ge3PS12 phase also exhibits a cubic argyrodite-type structure.
The diﬀraction peaks of this new phase were indexed assuming a cubic
unit cell with an F-43m space group. Interestingly, the shifts of a
number of peaks to higher angles compared to the Li7PS6 pattern
indicate that the new phase contains smaller lattice parameters.

The crystal structure of the new phase was determined using
synchrotron X-ray diﬀraction data of the powdered Li7Ge3PS12 sample
at 25 °C. A two-phase model based on Li7Ge3PS12 argyrodite (space
group: F-43m) and Li4P2S6 (space group: P63/mcm) as the main phase
and second impurity phase, respectively, was used for the reﬁnement.
The initial parameters for the Rietveld reﬁnement of Li7PS6 were also
employed for the novel material, i.e., space group F-43m (no. 216), Li
at 48 h, P at 4b, and S at 16e, 4a, and 4c sites [27]. Since Li7Ge3PS12
has a larger number of multivalent cations in its structure, the positions
of P and Ge were initially examined for both the 48 h and 4b sites.
Indeed, the reﬁnement provided a good reliability factor assuming that
both Ge and P occupy the original position of the P 4b site in the cubic
argyrodite-type structure. In addition, the Li and Ge components were
reﬁned at the original Li positions of the 48 h site. The ﬁnal reﬁnement
and structural parameters are summarized in Table 2, and the
interatomic distances and bond angles are outlined in Table 3.
Furthermore, the reﬁnement pattern is shown in Fig. 4. From these
results, we determined that the two-phase model provided a good
ﬁtting, with an Rwp value of 2.45%.
Fig. 5 shows the structure of the argyrodite-type Li7Ge3PS12
structure determined using the above reﬁnement results. This new
phase adopts a cubic structure with a lattice parameter, a, equal to
9.78525(5) Å, which is smaller than that of Li7PS6 (a =9.993 Å). The
structure is characterized by the ordered arrangement of four (Ge/P)S4
tetrahedra, which contrasts to both the four PS4 tetrahedra present in
Li7PS6 and the anion substituted system observed for Li6PS5X (X = Cl,
Br, I). In addition, lithium ions are distributed in the tetrahedral 48 h
site, which exists in a bi-pyramidal structure formed by two LiS4
tetrahedra connected through face sharing. Structural analysis indi-
cated that Ge was also distributed in the 48 h site, with reﬁnement
results giving Li and Ge occupation parameters in the 48 h site of 0.42
and 0.08, respectively. In addition, the (Ge/P)-S bond distance (i.e.,
2.093 Å) in the (Ge/P)S4 tetrahedra of Li7Ge3PS12 is larger than that in
Li7PS6 (i.e., 2.042 Å), which is consistent with the diﬀerence in the
ionic radii between P and Ge (ionic radii: Li(C.N.4) =0.59 Å; Ge(C.N.4)
=0.39 Å; P(C.N.4) =0.17 Å). Furthermore, the Li-S distance of 2.41–
2.52 Å in the LiS4 tetrahedra of Li7Ge3PS12 is shorter than that of
Li7PS6 (i.e., 2.45–2.59 Å), which indicates substitution of the smaller
Ge ion at the Li 48 h site. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
report to demonstrate the co-existence of Ge with Li at the center of
tetrahedral sites in sulﬁde compounds. The contracted bond length
between (Li/Ge) and S and the occupation parameter of Ge in the 48 h
site (g(Ge)/[g(Li)+g(Ge)] =0.24) support the structural model with the
partial distribution of Ge in Li sites. Although detailed structural
analysis with neutron powder diﬀraction will be examined in the
future, these structural changes are consistent with the lower lattice
parameter for the novel Ge-substituted phase.

the intercept of the extrapolated straight line with the x-axis (i.e., the Zʹ
value at Zʹʹ =0) corresponds to the sum of the bulk and grain boundary
contributions of the samples, and the ionic conductivity could be
calculated as the sum of the bulk and grain boundary resistance values.
Indeed, our material exhibited similar behavior to previously reported
solid-sulﬁde lithium-ion conductors [23]. In addition, the temperature
dependence of the Li7Ge3PS12 conductivity is shown in Fig. 6(b). The
conductivity value for the new material at 25 °C was determined to be
1.1×10−4 S cm−1, which is high compared to that of Li6PS5X (X = Cl,
Br, I) (i.e., 10−7–10−4 S cm−1) [15]. Furthermore, the high ionic
conductivity could be attributed to the disordered arrangement of
lithium ions within the structure, which is characteristic of argyrodite-
type lithium-ion conductors (see Table 4) [15]. As indicated, the
conductivity of Li7Ge3PS12 is comparable to that of fast lithium-ion
conductors, such as Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br). Moreover, the activation
energy during the heating process was calculated to be 25 kJ mol−1 at
25–100 °C, which is lower than that of Li7PS6 (i.e., 32 kJ mol−1) [8].
Based on synchrotron XRD data, the presence of amorphous and
Li4P2S6 impurities was also indicated in addition to the main

reported previously [28]. The contribution of the non-crystalline phase
to the observed high ionic conductivity was conﬁrmed by measuring
the conductivity of the pure non-crystalline phase synthesized by
quenching the mixture of the same composition with Li7Ge3PS12 from
950 °C. In this case, the conductivity of the glass sample was estimated
to be ~10−6 S cm−1. In addition, the conductivity of Li7Ge3PS12 (i.e.,
1.1×10−4 S cm−1) was higher than those of both Li4PS6 and the non-
crystalline phases by two or three orders of magnitude. Therefore, the
observed conductivity for the mixture was mainly attributed to the
intrinsic properties of the crystalline Li7Ge3PS12, as the single
Li7Ge3PS12 phase is expected to exhibited higher conductivity than
1.1×10−4 S cm−1.
However, the activation energy for ionic conduction in Li7Ge3PS12
is signiﬁcantly higher than those of Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br), despite the
similarities between the lattice sizes, thus indicating that the ionic
conduction mechanism of Li7Ge3PS12 diﬀers from that of Li6PS5X (X =
Cl, Br). Although the high ionic conductivity of Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br) is
due to the disordered arrangement of S2−and X−ions in the structure,
it appears that the high ionic conductivity of Li7Ge3PS12 is attributed to
the distribution of cations within the structure, and in particular the
distribution of Li+ ions. Thus, determination of the detailed cation
distribution in the structure by neutron diﬀraction studies will allow
the ionic conduction mechanism of Li7Ge3PS12 to be elucidated.
Fig. 7 shows the DTA curves of Li7Ge3PS12 during heating and
cooling, and the XRD patterns recorded both before and after the DTA
measurements are also shown. During heating, exothermic and en-
dothermic peaks were observed at 450 and 570 °C, respectively. The
exothermic peak is generally caused by a transformation from a
metastable to a stable phase upon heating, which suggests that the
Li7Ge3PS12 is in a metastable state at low temperatures. The series of
endothermic peaks at ~550 and 570 °C correspond to a phase transi-
tion to the low-temperature phase of Li7Ge3PS12 and the melting of the
phase, respectively. In the cooling cycle, the liquid-solid phase transi-
tion was conﬁrmed at 520 °C, with crystallization at 500 °C being
indicated by an exothermic peak. In addition, a small endothermic
peak was observed at 370 °C in the cooling cycle, which was assigned to
the phase transition from a metastable phase to a stable phase. From
the XRD measurements following DTA, no clear change in crystal
structure was observed, which indicates that the reaction kinetics of the
metastable (high temperature) to stable (low temperature) phase
transition were particularly low. The phase relationship around the
low- and high-temperature phases will be elucidated in further studies.
The all-solid-state battery properties were then examined using
Li7Ge3PS12, Li-In, and LiNbO3-coated LiCoO2/Li10GeP2S12 as the
electrolyte, anode, and cathode materials, respectively. Fig. 8 shows
the charge-discharge curves of the cell at 25 °C. The plateau regions of
the charge curves at approximately 3.4 V likely correspond to the
lithium extraction/insertion reaction of LiCoO2. In addition, the cells
exhibited an initial discharge capacity of ~80 mAh g−1, which is slightly
smaller than capacities reported for all-solid-state batteries containing

a sulﬁde-based electrolyte [29]. Furthermore, although the capacity
decreased following the 1st cycle, we expect that the cycling character-
istics can be improved by optimization of the mixing and processing
conditions employed during cell fabrication [17]. Thus, the above
results indicate that Li7Ge3PS12 is a potential candidate for use as a
solid electrolyte in all-solid-state batteries.
4. Conclusions
Novel lithium-ion conducting solids were identiﬁed within the
quasi-ternary Li2S–GeS2–P2S5 system, and the cubic argyrodite-type
Li7Ge3PS12 was identiﬁed as a possible material for application as a
solid electrolyte in all-solid-state batteries. The crystal structure of this
material was found to contain isolated (Ge/P)S4 tetrahedra, which
formed the framework structure, with Li and Ge being distributed in
the three-dimensional channels within the assembly. This material
exhibited a high ionic conductivity of 1.1×10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C and a
low activation energy of 25 kJ mol−1, in addition to demonstrating
phase stability up to 400 °C. We therefore expect that the discovery of
this novel material and its relatively high ionic conductivity will aid in
the design of superior lithium-ion conductors exhibiting the argyrodite-
relationships in the low- and high-temperature phases of this material.
Finally, use of neutron diﬀraction studies to determine the cation
distribution within the structure is expected to allow elucidation of the
ionic conduction mechanism of Li7Ge3PS12.

The novel lithium-ion conductor Li7Ge3PS12 was synthesized by slow cooling from the ternary Li2S–GeS
system, and was shown to exhibit a cubic argyrodite-type structure. The phase composition was determi
varying the ratio of starting materials; the observed monophasic properties were close to those f
Li7Ge3PS12 composition. The lattice parameter (a =9.80192(3) Å) of Li7Ge3PS12 was slightly smaller tha
of Li7PS6 (a =9.993 Å), indicating that substitution of a Li cation by the smaller Ge cation contracted th
lattice. In addition, the novel structure consisted of a framework composed of four isolated (Ge/P)S4 tetra

Finally, Li7Ge3PS12 exhibited a high ionic conductivity of 1.1×10 [−][4] S cm [−][1] at 25 °C and an activation en

-ion conductors are of great interest for use as solid
in lithium-ion batteries, as they have the potential to allow
under significantly more severe conditions than those
current battery systems [1,2]. In particular, the developble and non-flammable electrolytes could improve battery
with solid electrolytes being promising candidates for this
owever, a number of issues remain, including the search for
electrolytes exhibiting high lithium-ion conductivity comhigh electrochemical and chemical stabilities [2–5]. Thus,
ry and development of new lithium-ion conducting solids is
to provide additional materials for all-solid-state battery

This material exists in the Li2S–GeS2–P2S5 system, which
s a number of other lithium-ion conductors with high ionic
es. Examples include Li4GeS4–Li3PS4 solid solutions with
N-type structure [6,7], Li7PS6 with the argyrodite-type
8,9], and Li7P3S11 glass ceramics [10]. Indeed, previous
e indicated that this quasi-ternary system could provide
el materials exhibiting high lithium-ion conducting charwith a number of materials potentially remaining unex


plored.
Among the various ionic conductors reported to date, ma
exhibiting an argyrodite-type structure can be considered inter
candidates because they allow anion/cation substitution in their c
structure [11]. The term argyrodite is derived from the m
Ag8GeS6. Various atomic substitutions in the structure of this m
have provided a wide range of argyrodite-type materials suitable f
ionic conduction of monovalent cations, including Ag [+] and Cu [+] [1
However, to date, only a few argyrodite-type materials had
reported as lithium-ion conductors in the anion/cation subst
Li7PS6 system. For example, halogen-substituted compounds su
Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) have cubic argyrodite-type structure
exhibit a lithium-ion conductivity of 10 [−][4] S cm [−][1] at room tempe

[14,15]. The argyrodite structure consists of 136 tetrahedral site
unit cell, including four isolated PS4 tetrahedra in a tetrahedrally
packed anion array, in which 24 lithium ions occupy sites with
remaining 132 empty tetrahedral sites [11]. This distribution of li
ions, which contributes to ionic diffusion, is characteristic o
argyrodite structure.
Thus, we herein report the development of a novel lithiu
conducting crystalline material, focusing on the ternary Li2S–
P2S5 system, examining a previously un-synthesized compositi
systematic materials search will be carried out to identify any
crystalline materials, and the relationship between structure and
conductivity will be investigated.

Li7PS6 (i.e., 2.042 Å), which is consistent with the difference
ionic radii between P and Ge (ionic radii: Li(C.N.4) =0.59 Å; Ge(C
=0.39 Å; P(C.N.4) =0.17 Å). Furthermore, the Li-S distance of
2.52 Å in the LiS4 tetrahedra of Li7Ge3PS12 is shorter than t
Li7PS6 (i.e., 2.45–2.59 Å), which indicates substitution of the sm
Ge ion at the Li 48 h site. To the best of our knowledge, this is th
report to demonstrate the co-existence of Ge with Li at the cen
tetrahedral sites in sulfide compounds. The contracted bond
between (Li/Ge) and S and the occupation parameter of Ge in th
site (g(Ge)/[g(Li)+g(Ge)] =0.24) support the structural model wi
partial distribution of Ge in Li sites. Although detailed stru
analysis with neutron powder diffraction will be examined i
future, these structural changes are consistent with the lower
parameter for the novel Ge-substituted phase.

However, the activation energy for ionic conduction in Li7Ge

Highly ion-conductive Li6PS5X (X=Cl, Br, I) Li-argyrodites were prepared through a high‐energy ball milling.
Electrical and electrochemical properties were investigated. Ball-milled compounds exhibit a high conductiv-
ity between 2 and 7×10−4 S/cm with an activation energy of 0.3–0.4 eV for conduction. These attractive proper-
ties were attributed to the spontaneous formation of crystallized Li-argyrodite during ball-milling. An optimization
of milling time led to a conductivity of 1.33×10−3 S/cm for the Li6PS5Cl phase with an electrochemical stability up to
7 V vs. lithium. An all solid state LiCoO2/Elec./In lithium ion battery using ball-milled Li6PS5Cl as electrolyte was suc-
cessfully assembled, and its room temperature performance is reported.

1. Introduction
For the past two decades, intensive research on lithium ion battery
technology attempted to optimize safety and durability issues linked
with the use of liquid electrolytes that may induce sizeable risks of
ﬁre and explosion in these high energy density electrochemical sys-
tems. In this respect, the so-called “all solid state” batteries, built around
non-ﬂammable solid electrolytes, are recognized as good alternatives.
Therefore, their development requires the use of an electrolyte showing
high lithium ionic conductivity at ambient temperature with high elec-
trochemical stability. A few of them, based on sulﬁdes glasses (Li2S–P2S5
systems), were reported by Hayashi to possess a good electrochemical
stability (up to 10 V) and were used to fabricate batteries with reason-
ably high energy densities [1]. Recently, Kanno et al. reported on a new
germanium-based ThioLiSICon solid electrolyte (Li10GeP2S12) presenting
a very high conductivity of 12 mS/cm at 298 K, which is comparable to
or higher than standard organic liquid electrolytes [2].
Argyrodites, a class of compounds derived from the mineral Ag8GeS6
[3], may possess high Ag+ or Cu+ ion conductivities, as reported for
γ-Ag9AlSe6 [4] or Cu6PS5Cl [5]. From preliminary impedance measure-
ments, Deiseroth et al. [6] reported in 2008 on cubic Li-containing
Argyrodites of general formula Li7−xPS6−xXx (0≤x≤1; X=Cl, Br, I) and
with promising high values for Li+ ion conductivities; they ranged from
10−2 to 10−3 S/cm, i.e., close to the conductivity of standard liquid elec-
trolytes. In 2010, Pecher et al. reported values close to 4×10−7 S/cm for
Li6PS5I [7]. Very recently and during the course of our study, Rao et al.
independently conﬁrmed a high ionic conductivity of 3×10−3 S/cm
and 7×10−3 S/cm at 298 K for Li6PS5Cl and Li6PS5Br, respectively;
both were prepared through mechanical milling and then heated for
5 h at 550 °C [8].
Besides ionic conductivity, the electrochemical stability “window” of
the foreseen solid electrolyte is one of the most important criteria for
battery applications. For instance, crystalline materials such as Li0.29-
La0.57TiO3 [9] and LiAl0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 [10] can be used as solid electro-
lytes, only in a speciﬁc potential window, above 1.7 V and 1.8 V vs. Li,
respectively. Aware of this, Stadler et al. recently reported on the
use of Br-containing Li-argyrodites compositions (samples provided
by Deiseroth; 1.0×10−4 S/cm at 298 K, electrochemically stable
from 1 to 5 V vs. Li/Li+) in all solid state batteries using carbon coat-
ed Li4Ti5O12 (c-LTO) and Li–Al alloy as active positive and negative
electrode materials, respectively [11]. Such a battery using a positive
electrode composite made of 70% c-LTO–30% Li6PS5Br poorly cycled
(40% loss of initial capacity after 30 cycles) at 70 °C at a rate of C/10.
This loss was ascribed to the deterioration of an interface due to the
repeated volume expansion/contraction of the Li–Al alloy during
lithium insertion/deintercalation.
In this study, we revisit the synthesis of Li6PS5X (X=Cl, Br, I)
Li-argyrodites electrolytes and show, by using an arsenal of characteri-
zation techniques, how the injection of a mechanical milling step during
their elaboration can positively affect their electrochemical/transport
properties.

Reagent-grade Li2S (Sigma Aldrich 99%), P2S5 (Sigma Aldrich 99%)
and LiX (Acros Organic 99%) crystalline powders were used as
starting materials and mixed in stoichiometric proportions to yield
global compositions of Li6PS5X (X=Cl, Br, I). The mechanical milling
treatment was carried out for 1 g overall mass of mixed powders
with 15 zirconia balls (ϕ10 mm, overall mass=29.8 g) in a zirconia
jar (45 ml). A high-energy ball milling apparatus (Pulverisette 7)
was used with a rotation speed ﬁxed at 600 rpm during 20 h via a
continuous step. Indeed, previous experiences showed that intermit-
tent millings (e.g., 2 h followed by 18 h with an intermediate grind-
ing) lead to less conducting samples.
Samples were then annealed in an autoclave placed in a tubular
furnace during 5 h at 550 °C. All processes were conducted under
argon atmosphere.
For phase purity, the samples were analyzed by laboratory powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD), using a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Co Kα
radiation (λ1=1.7892 Å, λ2=1.7932 Å) equipped with a Super Speed
linear detector. The proﬁles matching reﬁnements of the XRD powder
patterns were performed using the WinPlotr program from the FullProf
suite [12].
Ionic conductivities were measured on pelletized samples obtained
by cold pressing (3400 kg/cm²) on C/Li6PS5X/C cell. The diameter and
the thickness of the pellets were 10 mm and ~1.5 mm, respectively
(compactness ~80%). Impedance spectroscopy was carried out under
Ar atmosphere, using a Multichannel Potentiostat (VMP 2, Biologic,
France) in the frequency ranging from 200 kHz to 10 mHz.
The samples were tested for their electronic conductivity by the
Hebb–Wagner polarization method [13]. Constant voltages from 2
to 5 V were applied stepwise by a potentiostat (VMP Biologic), in a
stainless steel/BM sample/Li cell, which allowed measuring the cur-
rent response.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were carried
out on a Netzsch DSC 204 F1 heat ﬂux differential calorimeter at a
heating rate of 10 K/min under a constant argon ﬂow of 200 ml/min.
The aluminum crucibles were ﬁlled with 4–5 mg of sample powder
and introduced in the glove box; once in the glove box they are covered
with a lid and pierced just prior to being measured.
The electrochemical properties of the Li-argyrodites were evaluat-
ed by cyclic voltammetry techniques. For such measurements, the
electrolyte was sandwiched between a stainless steel disk working
electrode and a lithium foil counter electrode. The potential sweeps
were performed using a VMP device with a scanning rate of 1 mV/s
from −0.5 V to +7 V (one sweep in 20 h).
All solid state half-cells were assembled by a cold press method
(ϕ10 mm, ~0.80 mm thickness, 200 bars) with a mixture of LiCoO2,
argyrodite phase and VGCF (vapor growth carbon ﬁber) (36/54/10
ratio) as composite positive electrode and In foil (100 μm) as counter
electrode. The cycling processes were performed using a VMP device
with a current density of 64 μA/cm² (55.265 μA in this conﬁguration)
between 3.3 and 4.3 V (vs. Li+/Li0).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of ball-milled phases
The XRD patterns of ball-milled samples shown in Fig. 1 present very
broad peaks characteristic of the Li6PS5Cl, Li6PS5Br and Li6PS5I phases. This
surprising ﬁnding simply indicates that crystallized argyrodites Li6PS5X
phases spontaneously form, through ball-milling and without post-
annealing, whatever the nature of the halogenide considered. Transmis-
sion electronic microscopy reveals the presence, besides the crystallized
grains, of a Li2S–P2S5–LiX (X=Cl, Br or I) amorphous matrix with, overall,
Here, we should recall that Rao&#x27;s samples obtained by mechanical
milling [8] only presented diffraction peaks belonging to the Li2S, P2S5
and LiX (X=Cl, Br or I) precursor phases. Such a difference is most
likely rooted in the energetic of the ball-milling process. Rao&#x27;s ball-
milling had been performed in an agate jar containing 15 agate balls
of ϕ10 mm corresponding to an overall mass of 13.9 g. We used zirco-
nia jar and balls; 15 balls of ϕ10 mm correspond to an overall mass of
29.8 g. Bearing in mind that heavier balls result in more energetic impacts
during milling at equal diameters [14,15], we can deduce that our ball-
milling process due to the use of zirconia balls (ρ=5.7 g/cm3) instead
of agate balls (ρ=2.65 g/cm3) was more energetic. We believe this
is the reason why we could directly prepare highly crystallized
Li-argyrodite phases through a simple ball-milling procedure.
The XRD powder patterns were successfully reﬁned in a cubic cell
(SGF-43m) with lattice parameters of 9.8397(4), 9.9689(4) and
10.1490(7) Ǻ for chloride, bromide and iodide, respectively. They are
in good agreement with those given in ICSD ﬁles (Li6PS5Br: 418488,
Li6PS5I: 418489, Li6PS5Cl: 418490). The unit cell volumes were shown,
as expected, to increase – V(Li6PS5Cl)bV(Li6PS5Br)bV(Li6PS5I) – with
increasing the ionic radii of the halogenide (RCl-bRBr-bRI-). The isotro-
pic peak broadening reﬁnements led to crystallite sizes in the range of
15 nm as deduced from the Scherrer equation implemented in the Ful-
lProf suite [12]. These argyrodite phases prepared by mechanical mill-
ing will be labelled from hereafter as “BM phases” (BM=ball-milled)
as opposed to the annealed ones described in the second part of this
section.
The total electronic conductivity (electron+hole) is 2.6×10−8
(Li6PS5Br), 6.4×10−9 (Li6PS5Cl) and 2.4×10−8 S/cm (Li6PS5I) using
the Hebb–Wagner polarization method [13]. On the other hand, respec-

Warburg curve with the x-axis (e.g., when the imaginary part is equal to
zero). Such values are in agreement with those reported by Deiseroth et
al. for the crystallized bromide and chloride phases, but differ for the
crystallized iodide phase for which a value of 10−7 S/cm was reported
as opposed to 1.9×10−4 S/cm for our sample.
Besides, we should note that our chloride- and bromide-containing
crystallized phases present higher conductivities (~20 times higher)
than the poorly crystallized ball-milled samples obtained by Rao [8], in-
dicating that the ionic conductivity is governed by the crystalline part of
the sample. In contrast, regarding the iodide-containing samples, our
results are in good agreement with those of Rao et al. suggesting that
in this case the ionic conductivity is governed by the amorphous part
of the sample.
Temperature-dependent ionic conductivities, as determined from the
analysis of each impedance spectrum, follow an Arrhenius-type law
(Fig. 3) with activation energies of 0.33, 0.41 and 0.35 eV for chloride, bro-
mide and iodide phase, respectively (calculated for temperatures ranging
from 25 °C to 150 °C). These values are a little bit higher than those
reported for other sulfur-based systems for solid electrolyte applications
[2,16], making their room temperature use more problematic.
Besides activation energy, another ﬁgure of merit for solid electro-
lytes is their electrochemical stability which was evaluated from cyclic
voltammograms collected on Li/BM-Li6PS5X/stainless steel current col-
lector cells (Fig. 4). Cathodic and anodic currents, observed close to
0 V, correspond to the metallic lithium deposit (Li+ + e−→Li) and
stripping (Li→Li+ + e−), respectively. Zooming in on the micro-
amps scale for chloride-containing phase exhibits a total absence of
any electrochemical response for at least ﬁve cycles (inlet), which is
ideal for battery application.
3.2. Characterization of annealed phases
In order to increase the amounts of crystallized phase in our sam-
ples, we chose to perform heat treatments at 550 °C for 5 h under Ar,
like for the original preparation of Li-argyrodite [6]. Indeed, several
heat treatments at intermediate temperatures were performed and no
improvement was noted until we reached temperatures of 550 °C. The
samples obtained after such annealing present narrow and intense
X-ray diffraction peaks of Li-argyrodites phases indicating an enhance-
ment of their coherent scattering domain (Fig. 5).
Additional diffraction peaks witness the presence of crystallized
LiX (X=Cl, Br or I) and Li2S impurities which had been previously
spotted within the BM samples through TEM observations. Two dif-
ferent heating rates (10 and 25 °C/min) were used, and faster heating
resulted in decreasing the amount of crystallized impurities (Fig. 5).
This phenomenon could be explained by the fact that during the heat
treatment, P2S5 at the surface turns into liquid and ﬂow-out the pellet; a
high rate of temperature enables to limit this P2S5 departure process,
hence “forcing” the P2S5 to react inside the pellet in order to form the
argyrodite phase. From the Scherrer equation we could deduce crystallite
sizes of ~90 nm for the argyrodite phase.
DSC measurements were performed on each BM-Li6PS5X composi-
tion. The DSC traces (Fig. 6) reveal broad exothermic peaks having

small intensity between 100 and 400 °C together with a few barely
detectable slope changes which we could not exploit reliably to de-
duce some basic physical characteristics, such as glass transition tem-
peratures or other properties.
Conductivities derived from Impedance Spectroscopy performed
on the annealed powders (crushed in mortar and then pressed into
pellet) for the bromide and chloride phases are similar to the ones
obtained for BM phases. This seems to indicate that neither the coarsen-
ing of the particles nor the increasing amount of LiX phases have an inﬂu-
ence on the ionic conductivity. Nevertheless additional experiments,
namely NMR and RAMAN spectroscopy, are in progress to grasp further
insight into the understanding of the minority phase role.
In contrast, annealing the iodide-containing sample induces a huge
decrease in conductivity from 2×10−4 to 10−7 S/cm (Fig. 7), this latter
value being consistent with that reported by Deiseroth for his crystallized
sample.
3.3. Optimization of chloride-containing phase synthesis
As the chloride-containing phase Li6PS5Cl shows no oxidation/reduc-
tion vs. Li in a wide voltage range, we decided to focus our study on
this composition for further improvements of the synthesis procedure
and electrochemical properties. We performed several ball-milling
sequences of different durations (1, 2, 5, 7.5, 10, 15 and 20 h). XRD pat-
terns were recorded after each experiment (Fig. 8).
Only broad peaks assigned to Li2S and LiCl were observed on the
XRD patterns of the samples obtained after 1 h or 2 h of ball-milling.
Upon 5 h of milling, a poorly crystalline Li6PS5Cl phase is observed
with the remaining Li2S. After 10–20 h of milling, the crystallized
Li2S phase has almost disappeared, and after 20 h, pure Li6PS5Cl is
mostly obtained.
Conductivities at 298 K derived from impedance spectroscopy
performed after each milling present an enhancement of the conduc-
tivity from 2×10−4 S/cm for 1 h to 1.33×10−3 S/cm for 10 h of mill-
ing. For longer durations, the conductivity then decreases (Fig. 9). We
have no explanation yet to account for such an observed minimum in
the ionic conductivity as the function of the milling time. Therefore,
we should recall that the ball-milling time dependence of the BET sur-
face area for ball milled samples shows similar curves, with the de-
crease at high ball-milling time being associated to a coalescence of
divided particles having high surface tensions. BET measurements
are being pursued to test whether such a BET–surface area–ionic con-
ductivity relationship does exist.
We then chose to perform preliminary battery tests with the
chloride-containing phase milled for 10 h because, out of the samples
we prepared, it is the one with the highest conductivity. The ﬁrst elec-
trochemical cycle obtained from a LiCoO2-based composite positive
electrode and an Indium negative electrode at a rate of C/20, presents
a charge capacity of 130 mAh/g of LiCoO2 and a reversible capacity of
~100 mAh/g, (Fig. 10).
The loss of discharge capacity observed can be related to the for-
mation of a passivation layer at the interface between LiCoO2 and
the electrolyte [17]. Moreover, one notes the small polarization of
the cell (150 mV) at quite high rates (C/20).

--------------------------------------------------
4. Conclusion
We have reported the elaboration, via a room temperature ball-
milling process, of Li6PS5X (X=Cl, Br or I) argyrodites showing ionic con-
ductivities which favorably compare to those initially reported for the
same phase prepared at 550 °C by traditional ceramics syntheses [6].
conductivities between 2 and 7×10
4 S/cm with an activation energy
of 0.3–0.4 eV, values close to that of Thio-LISICON reported by Kanno
[2]. Although annealing treatments performed on the ball-milled pow-
ders have led to an enhancement of the crystallites size of the Li6PS5X par-
ticles and a crystallization of LiX and Li2S impurities, they did not result in
any improvement of the overall ionic conductivity, at least for the Br‐ and
Cl-based phases. Lastly, by tuning the ball-milling synthesis parameters
we demonstrated the feasibility of obtaining, at room temperature and
in a record time of 10 h (Fig. 11), a Li6PS5Cl phase having a conductivity
of 1.33×10−3 S/cm at 298 K. Such a newly made solid electrolyte was
implemented into an In/Li6PS5Cl/LiCoO2 solid electrolyte battery, and
the ﬁrst preliminary results are encouraging for future developments.

rization of ball-milled phases


patterns of ball-milled samples shown in Fig. 1 present very
characteristic of the Li6PS5Cl, Li6PS5Br and Li6PS5I phases. This
nding simply indicates that crystallized argyrodites Li6PS5X
taneously form, through ball-milling and without posthatever the nature of the halogenide considered. Transmisic microscopy reveals the presence, besides the crystallized

Here, we should recall that Rao&#x27;s samples obtained by mecha
milling [8] only presented diffraction peaks belonging to the Li2S,
and LiX (X =Cl, Br or I) precursor phases. Such a difference is m
likely rooted in the energetic of the ball-milling process. Rao&#x27;s
milling had been performed in an agate jar containing 15 agate
of ϕ10 mm corresponding to an overall mass of 13.9 g. We used z
nia jar and balls; 15 balls of ϕ10 mm correspond to an overall ma
29.8 g. Bearing in mind that heavier balls result in more energetic imp
during milling at equal diameters [14,15], we can deduce that our
milling process due to the use of zirconia balls (ρ=5.7 g/cm [3] ) ins
of agate balls (ρ=2.65 g/cm [3] ) was more energetic. We believe
is the reason why we could directly prepare highly crystall

resulted in decreasing the amount of crystallized impurities (

ABSTRACT: A hexagonal analogue, Li6SiO4Cl2, of the cubic lithium
argyrodite family of solid electrolytes is isolated by a computation−
experiment approach. We show that the argyrodite structure is equivalent
to the cubic antiperovskite solid electrolyte structure through anion site and
vacancy ordering within a cubic stacking of two close-packed layers.
Construction of models that assemble these layers with the combination of
hexagonal and cubic stacking motifs, both well known in the large family of
perovskite structural variants, followed by energy minimization identiﬁes Li6SiO4Cl2 as a stable candidate composition. Synthesis and
structure determination demonstrate that the material adopts the predicted lithium site-ordered structure with a low lithium
conductivity of ∼10−10 S cm−1 at room temperature and the predicted hexagonal argyrodite structure above an order−disorder
transition at 469.3(1) K. This transition establishes dynamic Li site disorder analogous to that of cubic argyrodite solid electrolytes in
hexagonal argyrodite Li6SiO4Cl2 and increases Li-ion mobility observed via NMR and AC impedance spectroscopy. The
compositional ﬂexibility of both argyrodite and perovskite alongside this newly established structural connection, which enables the
use of hexagonal and cubic stacking motifs, identiﬁes a wealth of unexplored chemistry signiﬁcant to the ﬁeld of solid electrolytes.
1. INTRODUCTION
Compounds related to the mineral argyrodite (Ag8GeS6) have
been the focus of considerable interest for over half a century.
The argyrodite family is compositionally ﬂexible, with the
general formula A(12−n−y)/m
m+

−(A = Ag+, Cu+, Cd2+,
etc.; L = Ga3+, Si4+, Ge4+, P5+, etc.; X = S2−, Se2−, Te2−; Y =
Cl−, Br−, I−),1 where the A cation content can vary from 3.25
to 9 to maintain charge neutrality. This family of compounds
contains examples of fast Ag+ and Cu+ ion conductors (e.g.,
Cu6PS5Cl1 and Ag7NbS6
2) as well as materials interesting for
their nonlinear optical properties (e.g., Cd3.25PS5.5I0.5
1) and
thermoelectric properties (e.g., Ag8SnSe6
3).
The reported crystal structures of argyrodites are related to
the high-temperature F4̅3m cubic polymorph of Ag8GeS6,
where A cations often demonstrate an extended dynamic
disorder. Static ordering of cations at low temperatures, along
with the corresponding structural displacements, can lead to
low-temperature polymorphs with lower symmetry.4,5 This
dynamic disorder in higher-symmetry polymorphs has led to
extensive investigations of argyrodites as potential solid-state
electrolytes in all solid-state lithium-ion batteries (ASSBs).6,7
In the lithium-containing argyrodites, the introduction of a
halide anion transforms the room-temperature orthorhombic
polymorph (Li7PCh6 (Ch = S, Se): space group Pna21) into
cubic symmetry (Li6PCh5X (X = Cl, Br, I): space group
F4̅3m), while charge compensation occurs via reduction of the
lithium content. The latter cubic phase exhibits an order−
disorder phase transition from static order (LT cubic phase) to
an extended dynamic disorder (HT cubic phase), with
delocalization of the lithium distribution.8 In cubic oxide
analogues such as Li6PO5Br, this phase transition does not
occur, and lithium localization within the F4̅3m structure is
maintained over a wide temperature range (173−873 K).9 In
the ordered F4̅3m structure of Li6PO5Br, lithium ions fully
occupy a single crystallographic 24g position. In the
dynamically disordered HT F4̅3m structure of the lithium
sulﬁde argyrodites, the additional available lithium sites
(Wyckoﬀposition 48h) and extended diﬀusion of Li+ are
linked to a dramatic increase in ionic conductivity by six orders
of magnitude.10,11 The most highly conducting Li-containing
argyrodites are based on mixed sulﬁde−halide compositions,
e.g., Li6PS5Br6 and Li6.35P0.65Si0.35S5Br, in which Li+ is
delocalized across 48h and 24g positions.12
The high-temperature F4̅3m argyrodite structure has
previously been described in terms of tetrahedral close-
packing1 or as localized pseudo-octahedral cages of A cations
surrounding one anion and separated by the other anions.10,11

structures of argyrodites and those of cubic antiperovskites,
which are themselves good conductors of lithium ions (i.e.,
Li3OCl1−xBrx).13 We extend this relationship, which provides a
framework for designing lithium-ion conductors, from cubic to
hexagonal antiperovskites and thus propose the lithium
hexagonal argyrodite family, computationally identifying
several new compositional targets within this family.
Li6SiO4Cl2 is then successfully synthesized following these
predictions based on mixed cubic and hexagonal stacking and
shows analogous dynamical cation site disorder to cubic
argyrodites, which is required for Li transport.
2. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
2.1. Computational Methods. Periodic plane-wave-based
density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using
the VASP code (version 5.4.4).14 All calculations were performed
with the projector-augmented wave method,15 a plane-wave cutoﬀ
energy of 700 eV, and a k-point spacing of 0.15 Å−1. Geometry
optimization of both atomic positions and unit cell parameters was
terminated once all forces fell below 0.001 eV Å−1. The PBE
functional16 was used to calculate relative energies and mechanical
properties, and the PBEsol functional17 was used for direct
comparison between computational and experimental crystal
structures. The convex hull of energies for all reported phases in
the Li−Si−O−Cl−Br and Li−Si−O−Cl−I phase ﬁelds was calculated
using pymatgen.18 Normal mode calculations were performed using
the harmonic approximation, with ﬁnite displacements of 0.01 Å and
including distortions of the unit cell. This allowed the calculation of
elastic constants, including the bulk and shear moduli.19 For
comparison with existing compounds, the elastic constants of
Li3OBr (Pm3̅m structure)20 and Li6PS5Br (Cc structure of
Li6PS5I)21 were computed using the same method.
2.2. Synthesis. 2.2.1. Materials. Li2CO3 (99.99%), SiO2 (silica
gel, technical grade, particle size 40−63 μm), and LiCl (&gt;99.0%) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
2.2.2. Synthesis of Li4SiO4.22 Precursors were dried overnight at
473 K before weighing. Li2CO3 (1.2331 g,) and SiO2 (0.5013 g) were
weighed according to the stoichiometric 2:1 ratio. The powders were
ground with an agate pestle and mortar for 15 min, placed into an
alumina crucible and heated in air to 1073 K at a ramp rate of 5 K
min−1, held at 1073 K for 12 h, and cooled at a ramp rate of 5 K
min−1. The resulting product was ground to obtain a ﬁne powder,
which was then used as a precursor in the ﬁnal synthesis step.
2.2.3. Synthesis of Li6SiO4Cl2−xBrx. Li4SiO4, LiCl, and LiBr were
vacuum-dried overnight (under 10−4 mbar) before placing them in an
Ar-ﬁlled glovebox. All precursors and resulting powders were then
handled in an Ar-ﬁlled glovebox. LiCl, LiBr, and Li4SiO4 were mixed
in the stoichiometric ratio, ground with an agate pestle and mortar for
15 min, and transferred to an alumina crucible. The crucible was
placed in a silica tube, which was sealed under vacuum (&lt;10−4 mbar).
The tube was heated to 798 K at a ramp rate of 5 K min−1, held at 798
K for 12 h, and cooled at a rate of 5 K min−1. Once cooled, the silica
tube was opened inside the Ar glovebox, and the powder was ground
in a pestle and mortar for further characterization.
Single crystals of Li6SiO4Cl2 were grown by mixing LiCl and
Li4SiO4 in the stoichiometric ratio, heating the mixture to 883 K at a
ramp rate of 5 K min−1, annealing it for 3 h, and slow cooling at 3 K
h−1 to room temperature.
2.3. Powder X-ray Diﬀraction. Routine assessment of sample
purity was carried out using a Bruker D8 Discover diﬀractometer with
monochromatic Cu radiation (Kα1, λ = 1.54056 Å) in a Debye
Scherrer transmission geometry with sample powders loaded into 0.5
mm borosilicate glass capillaries.
Synchrotron X-ray diﬀraction (SXRD) was performed at Diamond
Light Source U.K., on high-resolution beamline I11,23 at λ = 0.826552
Å. The pattern was recorded in transmission mode [0° &lt; 2θ &lt; 150°]
using a multianalyzer crystal (MAC) detector
The sample was
experiment was performed at room temperature.
Synchrotron variable temperature X-ray diﬀraction (VT-XRD) was
performed in transmission mode using a position-sensitive detector
(PSD, λ = 0.82660 Å) on a sample, which was introduced into a 1.0
mm diameter silica capillary. The experiment was performed in the
temperature range of 298−798 K in 25 K steps on heating and then
cooled directly to room temperature to assess reversibility.
Rietveld reﬁnements were carried out using TOPAS Academic.24
Initially, Pawley ﬁts were performed on SXRD data, reﬁning the lattice
parameters and the background using a Chebyshev function with 12
parameters. The peak shape was modeled using a pseudo-Voigt
function (high-temperature patterns) and a Thomson−Cox function
(room-temperature patterns). Reﬁned parameters from ﬁnal Pawley
ﬁts were then used as starting points for Rietveld reﬁnements where
the following parameters were reﬁned: (1) scale factor, (2) atomic
coordinates, (3) isotropic (Li, Si, O) and anisotropic (Cl)
displacement parameters, and (4) atomic occupancies: the occupan-
cies of Cl and O, and Li were reﬁned, while the occupancy of the Si
site was set to the nominal value and the Li occupancies were set to
ensure charge compensation.
2.4. Single-Crystal X-ray Diﬀraction. A twinned crystal was
examined with a Rigaku MicroMax-007 HF X-ray generator equipped
with a Mo Kα rotating-anode microfocus source and a Saturn 724+
detector. The data were collected at 100 K. Reﬁnement of the cell
parameters, indexing of twin components, and reduction of the data
were performed on the obtained diﬀraction images with the use of the
software package CrysAlisPro.25 The volume ratio of the twin
components was about 1:1. The degree of overlap of two components
is around 1%. The twin operator is 92.82° rotation around the −0.59
0.37 −0.72 reciprocal axis. The detwinned HKLF4 format ﬁle was
used for structure solution using Olex2.26 The crystal structure was
solved with the intrinsic phasing method provided by the ShelXT27
structure solution program. Reﬁnements were carried out with the
ShelXL28 reﬁnement package using least-squares minimization.
2.5. Diﬀerential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Heat ﬂux
proﬁles were measured from 15.1 mg of powdered sample in a 40
μL aluminum crucible cold-welded under an Ar atmosphere (&lt;0.1
ppm O2, H2O) using a Netzsch DSC 404 F1 diﬀerential scanning
calorimeter. Data were recorded on heating to 823 K and then cooling
to 323 K using heating and cooling rates of 10 K min−1 under a
constant 50 mL min−1 ﬂow of helium. The transition temperature is
the average of the values obtained from both the heating and cooling
curves, which were extracted through peak ﬁtting.
2.6. Alternating current (AC) Impedance Spectroscopy and
Direct Current (DC) Polarization. A pellet of Li6SiO4Cl2 was made
by uniaxially pressing ∼30 mg of material in an 8 mm cylindrical steel
die at a pressure of 125 MPa. The pellet was sintered in an evacuated,
ﬂame-dried silica tube for 12 h at 848 K. Using this method, a relative
density of 84% was achieved.
AC impedance measurements were conducted using an impedance
analyzer (Keysight impedance analyzer E4990A). A sputtered gold
coating of 300 nm thickness was used as the ion blocking electrodes.
Sputtering was achieved under an argon atmosphere using a Q150R
sputter coater, and temperature-dependent conductivity measure-
ments were performed under an argon atmosphere over a frequency
range of 2 MHz to 20 Hz (with an amplitude of 100 mV).
Measurements were performed in the temperature range of 333−575
K in 20 K steps. The ZView2 program29 was used to ﬁt the impedance
spectra with an equivalent circuit.
A pellet of 84% relative density was used for DC potentiation
polarization measurements. DC polarization data was collected at 300
°C on a Au|Li6SiO4Cl2|Au symmetric cell by applying constant
potentials of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 V for 7200 s and monitoring the
current variation with time. Once a constant current was achieved, the
current was recorded and plotted against the applied voltage allowing
for the electronic conductivity (σe) to be extracted from the following
equation

where U refers to the polarization voltage, l refers to the pellet
thickness, A refers to the Au electrode area, and I refers to the current.
2.7. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy. 29Si
magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra were recorded with a 4
mm HXY MAS probe in double resonance mode on a Bruker 9.4 T
Avance III HD spectrometer. 29Si NMR data was obtained using a
pulse length of 5 μs at a radio frequency (rf) amplitude of 50 kHz and
at an MAS rate of νr = 10 kHz. The sample was packed into a rotor in
an Ar-ﬁlled glovebox to eliminate exposure to air and moisture. 29Si
chemical shifts were externally referenced to the lowest-frequency
signal of octakis(trimethylsiloxy)silsesquioxane at −109 ppm,30
relative to tetramethylsilane primary reference at 0.0 ppm.
Variable temperature 7Li NMR experiments were recorded with a 4
mm HX High-Temperature MAS Probe on a 9.4 T Bruker Avance III
HD spectrometer under static conditions with the X channel tuned to
7Li at ω0/2π (7Li) = 156 MHz. The sample was sealed in a glass
ampoule, and the spectra were recorded with a pulse length of 1.5 μs
at an rf ﬁeld amplitude of ω1/2π = 83 kHz and referenced to 10 M
LiCl in D2O at 0 ppm.
The homonuclear dipolar coupling constant between two

where μ0 is the permeability of free space, ℏis the reduced Planck’s

distance.
Temperature calibrations were performed using the chemical shift
thermometers Pb(NO3)2 using 207Pb NMR31 and by monitoring the
phase transition of CuI and CuBr using 63Cu NMR.32,33 The errors
associated with this method were calculated using the isotropic peak
line broadening and range from 5 to 20 K.
2.8. Maximum Entropy Methods (MEM). Maximum entropy
method (MEM) analysis was performed on SXRD and VT-XRD data
using the software Jana200634 and BayMEM.35 Rietveld models from
Topas were input into Jana2006, which was used to extract Fobs and
generate MEM inputs BayMEM was used to calculate the electron
density distribution using the Fobs and the number of electrons in the
nominal stoichiometry. Calculations using the number of electrons
associated with a 10% Li deﬁciency were also performed for all
models investigated and found to have negligible impact in the
resulting electron density distributions. All MEM results were
visualized in the VESTA crystal structure visualization software.36
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Selection of Target Compounds by Structural
Analogy between Argyrodite and Perovskite. We
describe the relationship between the argyrodite structure,
exempliﬁed by Li6PO5Br (Figure 1a), and the cubic
antiperovskite structure. In analogy with perovskites of general
formula ABX3, Li6PO5Br can be written as [((PO4)0.5Br0.5)-
(O0.5□0.5)Li3]2, where □is a vacancy. As such, Li6PO5Br
could be considered as an inverse double perovskite. When
viewed as a cubic antiperovskite, the lithium ions in Li6PO5Br
replace the anion positions in the conventional cubic
perovskite (e.g., SrTiO3;37 Figure 1b). The phosphate
polyanions and bromide anions replace the larger A-site
cations in a rock-salt-ordered fashion. As the cubic perovskite
can be represented as a cubic close-packed stacking of AX3
layers along [111], here the cubic stacking is an alternation of
Li3Br and Li3PO4 layers that produces the rock-salt anion
ordering. The remaining, isolated oxide anions, then occupy
half of the octahedral B-site positions between these layers also
in an ordered manner, leaving the other half of the B-sites
vacant. The P−O bond vector of each tetrahedral (PO4)3−
anion is directed toward the vacant B-sites, coupling the rock-
salt order of the two A-site anions to the anion vacancy defect
ordering on the B-site. Rock-salt order of 50% B-site vacancies
occurs in the structure of well-known K2PtCl6
38 (Figure 1c).
When considering these structural similarities between the
lithium argyrodites and the lithium antiperovskites, it is evident
that the lithium sites in both structures are topologically
equivalent. As a result, both structures share the same network
of connectivity between lithium sites (Figure 1d,e), suggesting
that the underlying mechanism for high ionic conductivity is

direction of the P−O bond vector oriented toward the vacant B-site), showing the relationship with (b) the cubic perovskite SrTiO3 (Sr: green, Ti:

--------------------------------------------------
and hexagonal perovskites associated with the distinct
stackings of the AX3 layers suggests the existence of hexagonal
Li argyrodites that are also based on alternating Li3Br and
Li3PO4 stackings.
Although closely related in composition to argyrodite, the
compound Cu8GeSe6 has a hexagonal P63mc high-temperature
polymorph rather than the cubic F4̅3m argyrodite struc-
ture,39−41 as do the compounds Ag5PS4I2
42 and Li8SiO6.4343
Analysis of these structures shows that they contain similar
close-packed layers to those present in the cubic antiperovskite
description of the argyrodite family, but that, instead of a −c−
(−a−b−c−) close-packed stacking, they are stacked in a
−h−c−h−c−(−a−b−a−c−) manner, as would occur in a
hexagonal antiperovskite. Diﬀerent close-packed layer stacking
motifs are known within the antiperovskites.44 The argyrodite/
cubic antiperovskite structural relationship suggests that Li-
containing materials based on the hexagonal, rather than cubic,
antiperovskite stacking of these layers, related to the hexagonal
structures of Cu8GeSe6 and Ag5PS4I2, would be analogous to
the lithium-containing argyrodites, where the number of Li
sites and extent of Li ordering among them control ionic
conductivity.
Starting from the cubic Li6PO5X (X = Cl, Br) argyrodites,
the phosphate (PO4)3−(P−O bond length: 1.54 Å) was
replaced with silicate (SiO4)4−(Si−O bond length: 1.65 Å) to
increase the A-site cation radius and thus drive a cubic to
hexagonal transition through the perovskite tolerance factor
(rP(V) = 0.17 Å, rSi(IV) = 0.26 Å).45 The isolated oxide ion was
replaced by a halide ion (F, Cl, Br, I) to balance charge.
Structures were built with compositions Li6SiO4XX′ (X, X′ =
F, Cl, Br, I) with the −h−c−h−c−(−a−b−a−c−) stacking
pattern, following Cu8GeS6, in the P63mc space group. This
aﬀords a hexagonal antiperovskite in which half of the A-sites
are occupied with silicate polyanions and half with halide
anions. Half of the B-sites are then occupied in an ordered
manner by the remaining halide anions, with the vacant B-sites
chosen to avoid interactions between the halide anions and the
corners of the silicate tetrahedra (Figure 2a).
This is a hexagonal analogue of the Li6PO5Br structure
described previously and an inverse analogue of the 4H-
hexagonal perovskites (e.g., 4H-BaMnO3,46 stacking sequence
−h−c−h−c (−a−b−a−c−); Figure 2b). These hexagonal Li
argyrodites contain similar close-packed AX3 layers to the
cubic argyrodites (i.e., alternating Li3Br and Li3PO4/Li3SiO4
layers) but they are stacked in a −h−c−h−c−(−a−b−a−c−)
pattern and not a −c−(−a−b−c−) stacking pattern (Figure
2c−h). These compositions were then screened computation-
ally to ﬁnd the lower-energy structures.
Periodic DFT calculations showed that the composition
Li6SiO4ClBr in this P63mc structure was the most stable when
compared with a stoichiometric combination of lithium
orthosilicate Li4SiO4 and the relevant binary lithium halides
(LiCl and LiBr) (Table S1). Through phonon calculations,
lower-energy structures than the high-symmetry hexagonal
structures were found, arising from the rotation of lithium
atoms oﬀthe mirror plane of P63mc through activation of
displacive Γ2, Γ3, Γ5, M2, and M3 modes (Figure 3b), leading to
four potential lower-symmetry polymorphs in space groups
P31c, P63, Pna21, and Pca21. The stabilities of all compositions
were recomputed in these four lower-symmetry polymorphs,
revealing that Li6SiO Cl
Li6SiO Br
Li6SiO ClBr
and
Li6SiO4ClI were predicted to be stable (Figure 3a, Table 1,
and Table S1).
These results suggest that a new lithium hexagonal
argyrodite family of compounds may be experimentally
accessible, with Li6SiO4Cl2 and Li6SiO4ClBr (with the larger
Br ordered on the A-site) predicted to be the most stable and
chosen as targets for experimental synthesis.
DFT calculations of the elastic constants of Li6SiO4Cl2 in
the Pna21 structure result in a computed bulk modulus, BDFT,
of 53 GPa and a computed shear modulus, GDFT, of 31 GPa.
This material is considerably softer than oxide solid-state
lithium electrolytes such as Li La Zr O
(B
= 117 GPa

structure (Ba: green, Mn: blue, O: red). The oxide anions in the
conventional hexagonal perovskite are replaced by lithium cations in
Li6SiO4ClBr, the A-site barium cations are replaced by an ordered
mixture of silicate polyanions and bromide anions, and the B-site
manganese cations are replaced by ordered chloride anions and
vacancies. In Li6SiO4ClBr, close-packed Li3Br layers (dark pink
lithium) alternate along the c-direction with close-packed Li3SiO4
layers (light pink lithium) in an −a−b−a−c−stacking sequence. Half
of the octahedral B-sites between these layers are then occupied by
chlorine anions (blue octahedra), leaving half of the B-sites vacant
(gray octahedra). (c−h) Comparing close-packed AX3 layers in

--------------------------------------------------
GDFT = 64 GPa)19 and has mechanical properties closer to that
of the lithium antiperovskites (e.g., Li3OBr, BDFT = 50.6 GPa,
GDFT = 37 GPa). Li6SiO4Cl2 is stiﬀer than related sulﬁde
compounds (e.g., Li6PS5Br: BDFT = 27 GPa, GDFT = 14 GPa)
and consequently easily meets the Monroe−Newman criterion
for the prevention of dendrite growth.47 Future electrolytes
based on these mixed oxide/halide compounds may thus be
able to overcome some of the processing challenges and
and sulﬁde ceramics.48
3.2. Synthesis, Thermal Behavior, and Structure
Determination. Compounds were synthesized as powders
with compositions Li6SiO4Cl2−xBrx (x = 0, 0.5,1) to explore
the computationally predicted targets. Synthesis of powders
was attempted at varying reaction temperatures (50 K steps
from 723 to 873 K) and reaction times (12, 24, 48 h), and
starting materials and resulting powders were handled under an
argon atmosphere and annealed in alumina crucibles in
evacuated silica ampoules (Section 2.2). Synthesis at 823 K
for 48 h yielded phase-pure powders for Li6SiO4Cl2. This new
phase persists in the compositional range Li6SiO4Cl2−xBrx (0 ≥
x ≥1) and displays increased lattice parameters as a function
of bromine content (Figure S1). Despite this clear indication
of anion substitution, all compositions with x &gt; 0 contained
impurities; only Li6SiO4Cl2 was synthesized as a phase-pure
white powder, and as such, all further discussion therefore
concerns Li6SiO4Cl2. Single crystals of Li6SiO4Cl2 were
synthesized by annealing at 883 K for 3 h before slow cooling
(3 K h−1) to room temperature. High-resolution synchrotron
XRD data (SXRD) were collected on the powder from 298 to
798 K in 25 K steps. At temperatures 473−498 K, convergence
of some peaks and disappearance of other small peaks indicate
a phase transition to a high-temperature, higher-symmetry
phase (denoted HT phase) (Figure 4a,b). This transition is
also observed in diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data
measured from Li6SiO4Cl2 powder, which shows endothermic
and exothermic events on heating and cooling, respectively,
associated with this reversible phase transition (Figure 4c).
The exact transition temperature determined from DSC data is
469.3(1) K, consistent with the observations from SXRD,
NMR, and AC impedance measurements (see below).
Similarly to the RT phase, the experimental SXRD pattern of
the HT phase could not be indexed to any known compounds
in the Li−Si−O−Cl phase ﬁeld. The structure of the RT phase
was solved by single-crystal (SC) X-ray diﬀraction and the HT
phase by the Rietveld reﬁnement of a computed starting model
against high-resolution SXRD data.
3.2.1. Room-Temperature Phase: Structure Determina-
tion. The crystal structure was solved in the space group Pna21
from a nonmerohedrally twinned crystal with lattice parame-
ters: a = 10.5204(8) Å, b = 6.0756(4) Å, and c = 9.9530(7) Å.
The assignments of Li, Si, O, and Cl were determined based on
interatomic distances and relative displacement parameters. All
atomic positions were reﬁned with ﬁxed fully occupied sites.
Lithium atoms exhibited nonpositive deﬁnite anisotropic mean
square displacements, so ISOR restraints were applied to
atoms Li1−6 during the ﬁnal reﬁnement and also to atoms
O2−4 as a result of distorted thermal ellipsoids. The ﬁnal
anisotropic atomic reﬁnement converged to R1 = 0.0530, wR2
= 0.1189 for reﬂections with I ≥2σ (I) and R1 = 0.0750, wR2 =
0.1279 for all reﬂections. Crystallographic data and structural
reﬁnements for Li6SiO4Cl2 are summarized in Table S2. The
asymmetric unit contains two distinct crystallographic Cl
positions, four distinct O positions, one Si position (further
conﬁrmed by 29Si solid-state NMR, which displays a main
signal at −67 ppm, Figure S2, corresponding to a SiO4
4−unit),
and six Li positions. The ﬁnal reﬁned atomic positions, and
isotropic and anisotropic displacement parameters of each
atom are given in Tables S3 and S4, and the selected bond
lengths and angles are given in Tables S5 and S6.

be the most stable compositions. (b) DFT-optimized structures of
Li6SiO4Cl2 (Li: pink, SiO4: green, Cl: light green and blue). In the
high-symmetry P63mc structure (center), half of the lithium ions lie
on mirror planes (shown in darker pink). Displacement of these
lithium ions oﬀthe mirror planes leads to a lowering of symmetry and
a reduction in the DFT-calculated energy. Triangles of lithium ions
are displaced by small rotations about the c axis. These rotations can
be in phase or out of phase, leading to the diﬀerent low-symmetry
structures shown. Rotations of lithium ions in the Li3SiO4 layers and
Li3Cl layers are shown by pink and white arrows, respectively.

Pna21 (e.g., (411)) symmetry are clearly visible in the
diﬀraction image, ruling out possible C-centered orthorhombic
or hexagonal (as a ≈√3b) supergroups.
The high-resolution room-temperature SXRD data further
conﬁrms this model showing subtle peak splitting consistent
with the Pna21 symmetry (Figure 4a, inset) evident due to
higher Q resolution in the synchrotron data.
The observed systematic absences in the SXRD data were
consistent with the Pna21 space group and the lattice
parameters reﬁned to a = 10.543155(5) Å, b = 6.07657(3)
Å, and c = 9.960255(5) Å from a Pawley ﬁt. The model
obtained from SC diﬀraction proved to be a good starting
point for the Rietveld reﬁnement with values of Rwp = 4.61 and
χ2 = 2.81 after the initial reﬁnement of site occupancies and
displacement parameters Cl and O site occupancies were
neutrality. Reﬁnement of atomic positions improved Rwp from
4.61 to 4.27 and χ2 from 2.81 to 2.61 (Figure S3). Small
impurity phases of LiCl (1.95%) and Li2SiO3 (2.35%) were
observed (Figure S4a). The maximum entropy method
(MEM) analysis did not show any additional electron density,
indicating that all lithium sites are accounted for in the
structural model described above (Figure S6). The ﬁnal
Rietveld ﬁt is shown in Figure 4a, and reﬁned structural
parameters are presented in Tables S7 and S8. The reﬁned
composition is Li5.957(2)Si1.00O3.986(2)Cl1.985(1), and the RT
phase will therefore be denoted RT-Li6SiO4Cl2 hereafter for
simplicity.
3.2.2. Room-Temperature Phase: Structure Description.
As described in Section 3.1, the orthorhombic structure arises
from the rotation of lithium atoms oﬀthe mirror plane in
P63mc through activation of Γ5 and M2 modes, stabilizing the
Pna21 symmetry. This leads to a change in anionic and cationic
coordination environments compared to the hexagonal defect
antiperovskite parent.
The experimentally determined RT structure is shown in
Figure 5a, highlighting the atomic packing within the structure
deﬁned by alternating Li3SiO4 and Li3Cl layers. Comparison of
the experimentally determined Pna21 structure to the
computed structure shows almost identical atomic positions
(Figure S7a). The chloride ions that occupy 50% of the
antiperovskite B-site positions (Cl1) are found in an octahedral
environment with bond lengths ranging from 2.415(3) to
2.621(3) Å to neighboring Li. Compared to the idealized
octahedral environment expected for B-site anions in
antiperovskites, the octahedra are distorted slightly as a result
of the nonrigid rotation of Li ions and the displacement of
chlorine toward neighboring vacant B-sites. The chloride ions
that occupy 50% of the A-site (Cl2), typically forming
cuboctahedral (12-fold) coordination environments in hex-
agonal perovskites such as 4H-BaMnO3, occupy a distorted
octahedral environment in the orthorhombic polymorph with
bond lengths from 2.446(3) to 2.798(7) Å (Figure S8). All
lithium atoms are found in tetrahedral LiCl2O2 coordination
environments. Due to the diﬀerence in ionic radii (rCl = 1.81 Å,
rO = 1.40 Å),45 lithium atoms are displaced toward the oxygen
atoms (Figure 5c). Li−O bond lengths vary from 1.829(3) to
1.931(3) Å, comparable to distances reported for the cubic
argyrodite Li6PO5Cl (1.93 Å)9 and shorter than Li−O bonds
in Li4SiO4 (1.84−2.51 Å).49 Li−Cl bond lengths range from
2.415(3) to 2.798(3) Å. These values are larger than expected
for typical LiCl4 bond lengths, e.g., 2.38 Å in Li2MgCl4.50 The
diﬀerence in bond lengths compared to homoleptic LiCl4 and
LiO4 tetrahedral environments is expected in heteroleptic
LiCl2O2 and optimizes the bond valence sum for Li+ (BVS:
0.939(8)−1.12(1)). The Li−Cl distances in Li6SiO4Cl2 are
shorter than in the cubic oxide argyrodite Li6PO5Cl (2.910(4)
Å), in which Li atoms have a trigonal bipyramidal coordination
(LiO3Cl2) with Cl occupying the axial positions.9
In the RT structure, LiCl2O2 tetrahedra are connected
through the corner-sharing of Cl and O vertices and the
sharing of Cl−Cl edges; they are referred to using the central
lithium atom, i.e., Li(1)O2Cl2 as a Li1 tetrahedron. Edge-
sharing between Li1−Li3 and Li4−Li6 tetrahedra is facilitated
by the lithium-ion displacements away from the shared Cl−Cl
edges (Figure 6a,c), minimizing electrostatic repulsions.
The Li3SiO4 layer can be described (Figure 6a) as
alternating corner-sharing Li2−Li3 and Li1−SiO
chains

running along b, connected in the a-direction by Li1−Li2,
SiO4−Li2, SiO4−Li3 corner-sharing, and Li1−Li3 edge-sharing
(Figure 6b,c). Cl2 atoms located in the Li3Cl layers connect
Li3SiO4 layers along the stacking c-direction (Figure 6b). The
Li3Cl layer is made up of Li4, Li5, and Li6 tetrahedra
connected through Li4−Li5, Li4−Li6, Li5−Li6 corner-sharing,
and Li4−Li6 edge-sharing (Figure 6c,d). The Li3Cl layer is
connected to the Li3SiO4 layer through corner-sharing with
Li1, Li2, Li3, and SiO4 tetrahedra, forming the three-
dimensional (3D)-network of corner- and edge-shared
tetrahedra.
3.2.3. High-Temperature Phase: Structure Determination.
Indexing of the HT phase (above 523 K) with TOPAS resulted
in a hexagonal unit cell with lattice parameters a = 6.11 Å and c
= 10.02 Å. Systematic absences in the powder pattern were
consistent with the P31c and P63mc space groups, agreeing
with the computationally stable hexagonal structures (Section
3.1 and Figure 3c). Very similar Pawley ﬁts were obtained
using these symmetries, and lattice parameters were reﬁned to
a = 6.110805(12) Å and c = 10.02068(3) Å for P63mc (Figure
S4b). The higher-symmetry computed P63mc structure gave a
reasonable starting point for the Rietveld reﬁnement. The unit
cell contains two distinct crystallographic Cl positions
(Wyckoﬀposition 2b), two O positions (Wyckoﬀpositions
6c and 2a), one Si position (Wyckoﬀposition 2a), and three Li
positions (Wyckoﬀpositions 6c and 12d). Occupancies of Cl
and O sites were reﬁned, and the occupancies of Li sites were
ﬁxed to ensure charge neutrality. In the computational model,
Li2 is located on the mirror plane in special position 6c (Figure
S7b). Inspection of the Fourier density map (FDM) reveals
extra electron density around this position and indicates
displacement of Li2 away from the mirror plane onto the
general position 12d (Figure S9a). Replacing the 6c site with
the 12d position improved R
from 3 61 to 2 98% The FDM

and Cl2 (light green) occupy the A-sites, Cl1 (blue) ions ﬁll 50% of the B-sites with the remaining 50% vacant, and lithium atoms occupy the X-
sites (Li1, Li2, Li3 atoms in light pink, Li4, Li5, Li6 atoms in dark pink). Vacant tetrahedral lithium sites in the Li3SiO4 layer are shown in white to
facilitate comparison with the HT structure. (b) HT-Li6SiO4Cl2 unit cell showing the same alternating Li3Cl and Li3SiO4 layers. Lithium atoms are

Li6SiO4Cl2 lithium tetrahedra showing displacement of lithium (4a Wyckoﬀsite) toward coordinating oxygen. The vacant tetrahedral sites (V),
drawn in white, are generated by activation of occupational modes when lowering the symmetry of HT-Li6SiO4Cl2 to Pna21 through
ISODISTORT (Figure S10). (d) HT-Li6SiO4Cl2 Li1a, Li1b (6c Wyckoﬀsite), and Li2 (12d Wyckoﬀsite) coordination environment, showing
partial occupancy of tetrahedral sites that are both fully occupied and vacant at RT. (e) This order−disorder behavior of lithium sites is analogous
to the lithium distribution in Li6PS5I argyrodite;21 at low temperatures (LTs), lithium atoms are ordered occupying one of the tetrahedral positions,
whereas at high-temperature (HT), lithium ions are disordered with partial occupancy of tetrahedral and trigonal positions. Distinct sulﬁde anion
positions are labeled in the HT structure. (f) Octahedral Li-ion cages surrounding B-site anions in Li6PO5Cl (cubic), HT-Li6SiO4Cl2 (hexagonal),
and Li6PS5Br (cubic). Trigonal anion windows (consisting of three oxide anions in Li6PO5Cl, two oxide anions and one chloride anion in
Li6SiO4Cl2, and two sulﬁde and one mixed sulﬁde/bromide site in Li6PS5Br) are shown, highlighting their anion−anion distances that determine
the window area. Two distinct trigonal windows are present in HT-Li6SiO4Cl2, with oxide ions both either occupying Wyckoﬀposition 6c (edge
length: 3.54 Å) or occupying Wyckoﬀpositions 2a and 6c (edge length: 3.23 Å). Lithium ions move through these windows in argyrodite solid
electrolytes.

--------------------------------------------------
also revealed electron density around the Li1 position along
the c-direction (Figure S9b). Splitting the Li1 site into two
distinct Li1a and Li1b sites along c further improved Rwp to
2.75%. The computed P31c model (Figure 3c) is similar, only
allowing two distinct 6c crystallographic sites for Li2 instead of
one 12d site. A ﬁt of the diﬀraction data to this model, with
independent reﬁnement of both Li2a and Li2b 6c occupancies,
did not result in an improved ﬁt. The P63mc model was
therefore used for ﬁnal reﬁnement. MEM analysis also supports
the displacement of Li1 and Li2 positions (Figure S6). The
ﬁnal reﬁnement is shown in Figure 4b, and the reﬁned
structural parameters are provided in Table S7. The reﬁned
composition is Li5.82(4)Si1.00O3.934(6)Cl1.956(4), and the HT phase
will therefore be denoted HT-Li6SiO4Cl2 hereafter for
simplicity.
3.2.4. High-Temperature Phase: Structure Description.
The HT P63mc structure can be described as a 4H-hexagonal
antiperovskite of general formula ABX3, with structural
similarities to 4H-BaMnO3 (Figure 2b) in which half of the
B-sites are vacant. This is consistent with cation-deﬁcient
hexagonal perovskites with the formula A2BX6, such as
Rb2MnF6 with the P63mc symmetry.51 The HT structure of
Li6SiO4Cl2, consisting of alternating hexagonally stacked Li3Cl
and Li3SiO4 layers, is shown in Figure 5b. The (poly)anion
network in the HT structure remains unchanged through the
phase transition from the RT structure, with the observed
symmetry change originating from displacements in Li
positions. The lithium environments remain tetrahedral
(LiO2Cl2) with lithium atoms displaced toward the oxygens
due to its smaller ionic radius compared to chlorine. Li−Cl
bond lengths vary from 2.366(3) to 2.908(8) Å, and Li−O
bond lengths range from 1.847(4) to 1.942(4) Å (Figure 5d).
As shown in Figure 5c,d, the ordered lithium atoms of RT-
Li6SiO Cl
are disordered in the higher-symmetry HT
described in Section 3.1, this order−disorder transition occurs
via activation of occupational M2 and Γ5 modes, with a small
contribution from displacive Γ5 modes that predominantly
involve displacement of the Li1 atoms within the close-packed
Li3SiO4 layer (Figure S10). This disorder of the A cation
positions is well known in A(12−n*−y)/m

dites52,53 and provides a direct comparison of Li disorder
between oxide and sulﬁde argyrodite materials. The delocaliza-
tion of Li positions in HT-Li6SiO4Cl2 resembles that observed
in high-temperature F4̅3m cubic argyrodites Li6PS5X (X = Cl,
Br, I), in which Li partially occupies both tetrahedral and
trigonal planar coordination environments (48h and 24g
Wyckoﬀsites, respectively; Figure S9c) and is one of the
reasons for reduced energy barriers for bulk Li-ion transport in
these materials.8
The order−disorder transition of Li6SiO4Cl2 (Figure 5c,d) is
similar to the behavior of many argyrodites; Cu8GeSe6 displays
an order−disorder transition between P63cm and P63mc
structures, where Cu ions are disordered in the latter similarly
to Li on the 6c and 12d Wyckoﬀpositions in Li6SiO4Cl2,39,54
and analogous behavior is observed in silver-containing
argyrodites.1 Speciﬁcally, cubic Li6PS5I has ordered lithium
positions at low temperature (&lt;180 K) and a disordered
structure at 298 K in which lithium is delocalized across the
24g and 48h positions (Figure 5e),21 resulting in comparable
local lithium coordination environments with Li6SiO4Cl2
(Figure 5c,d) that are consistent with dynamical disorder.
This is distinct from the cubic oxide argyrodite, Li6PO5Br, in
which lithium remains localized on the trigonal planar 24g
Wyckoﬀposition in the F4̅3m structure over a wide (173−873
K) temperature range (Figure 1e).48 Stabilization of this
lithium disorder, which enables access to higher-energy sites in
Li6SiO4Cl2, would increase lithium-ion migration compared
against the room-temperature structure.
3.3. Transport Properties. The ionic conductivity of
Li6SiO4Cl2 was investigated through AC impedance spectros-
copy on a sintered white pellet of ∼84% theoretical density
(pellet cold-pressed under 125 MPa and sintered in an
evacuated silica ampoule for 12 h at 848 K). A typical set of
data measured at 533 K in an inert atmosphere are shown in
Figure 7a. The impedance complex plane plots, Z*, consist of a
high-frequency arc with the presence of a small low-frequency
inclined spike. The large single arc is attributed to the sample
bulk, as shown by overlapping peaks in the combined Z″/M″
spectra (Figure S12a). The associated capacitance of the high-
frequency arc, 0.6 pF cm−1, corresponding to a permittivity of
∼6.8, is also consistent with the grain response (Figure S12b).
The low-frequency spike is attributed to the double-layer
capacitance at the blocking sample−electrode interface, where
Li ions cannot pass. To a ﬁrst approximation, the high-
frequency arc could be modeled with an equivalent circuit
consisting of a resistor in parallel with a constant phase
element (CPE). Impedance data were ﬁtted to the equivalent
circuit using ZView software (Figure 7a). In general, the
material is homogeneous and shows a total conductivity of 6.2
× 10−6 S cm−1 at 575 K and ∼10−10 S cm−1 at room
temperature. DC polarization measurements show a low
electronic contribution of &gt;0.5% at 300 °C to the overall
conductivity (eq 1 and Figure S13). From the low-frequency
intercept of the impedance arc on the Z′ axis, the values of the
total resistance were obtained and are shown in an Arrhenius
format in Figure 7b A change in slope can be observed above

∼498 K, agreeing with the phase transition observed via VT-
XRD and DSC experiments. The orthorhombic phase (red
circles) and the hexagonal phase (black squares) have
activation energies of 0.560(8) and 0.444(9) eV, respectively.
The local ionic mobility of lithium was investigated through
7Li solid-state NMR. The temperature dependence of the static
7Li NMR spectra of Li6SiO4Cl2 over the temperature range of
331−593 K is shown in Figure 7c. At temperatures where ion
mobility is minimal, i.e., the rigid lattice regime, the 1/2 ↔
−1/2 central transition is broadened by the
7Li−7Li
homonuclear dipolar coupling. For Li6SiO4Cl2, this region is
between 350 and 450 K, where the line width of the central
transition is ∼5.5 kHz. As the temperature is increased above
450 K, the line width decreases drastically over a small
temperature range (Figure 7d) due to the increasing motion of
the Li spins continuously averaging the dipolar interactions
and clearly evidences an increase in ionic mobility facilitated by
the phase transition from the ordered RT-orthorhombic to the
higher-symmetry HT-hexagonal phase.
Through calculation of the strength of 7Li−7Li homonuclear
dipolar coupling of both the room-temperature and high-
temperature phases of Li6SiO4Cl2, further insight into the local
ion dynamics of the two phases can be determined. By
extracting the shortest Li−Li distance from the SXRD data
(Li1−Li5, 2.697(6) Å), the absolute value of the dipolar
coupling constant can be calculated (eq 2) as ∼5.8 kHz in RT-
Li6SiO Cl in full agreement with the experimental line width
observed, while ∼8.2 kHz is obtained from Li1a and Li2
(2.410(5) Å) for HT-Li6SiO4Cl2. Due to the increase in
dipolar coupling after the phase transition, it would be
expected that 7Li spectra demonstrate increased line widths
at higher T in the absence of an increase in Li-ion mobility.
However, the line narrowing observed (Figure 7d) is a clear
indication that the phase transition from the RT-orthorhombic
phase to the higher-symmetry HT-hexagonal phase facilitates
an increase in Li-ion mobility, as also observed in AC
impedance measurements (Figure 7b). The delocalization of
lithium in HT-Li6SiO4Cl2 across the 6c and 12d sites (Figure
5c,d) results in a lowering of the activation energy from RT-
Li6SiO4Cl2 where the lithium positions are fully ordered. The
activation energies obtained from Li6SiO4Cl2 are lower than
those extracted from Li6PO5Cl across the measured temper-
ature range, despite the latter adopting the higher-symmetry
cubic F4̅3m structure.9
The distinction between the oxide materials Li6SiO4Cl2 and
Li6PO5Cl is likely the increased size of the trigonal anion
window (Figure 5f) and the associated dynamical Li disorder
(absent in cubic Li6PO5Cl, where Li is localized on the 24g
position) in hexagonal Li6SiO4Cl2 (partial occupancy of 6c and
12d positions by Li), leading to lower activation energies for
ion mobility. Local jumps of Li+ between these tetrahedral sites
separated by the trigonal anion windows are the most favorable
for ionic diﬀusion in argyrodites.8 Occupational disorder via
chalcogenide−halide mixing on the anion position that forms

the low-frequency inclined spike attributed to the capacitance of the blocking electrode. (b) Arrhenius plots of the total conductivity; activation
energies derived from the data are shown. A change in Arrhenius behavior and activation energy can be seen at ∼470 K corresponding to the phase
change observed in VT-XRD and DSC measurements. (c) 7Li NMR spectra under static conditions as a function of temperature. (d) Motional
narrowing of the line width (full width at half-maximum) of the central 7Li NMR transition. The temperature at which the phase change is detected
via DSC measurements is also noted (dashed line).

--------------------------------------------------
(Figure 5f) is an important route to enhancing Li-ion
mobility.12,54 Unlike Li6PO5Cl, where this window is formed
from three oxide anions, the LiCl2O2 environments of
Li6SiO4Cl2 yield a window described by one chloride and
two oxide anions. The larger Cl (rCl = 1.81 Å, rO = 1.40 Å)45
increases the size of this window, further lowering the
activation energy of ion transport compared to Li6PO5Cl.
4. CONCLUSIONS
The connection between argyrodite and antiperovskite
structures is established, thus identifying close-packed layers
that can be assembled through the diversity of combined
hexagonal and cubic stacking operations known to give the
perovskite material family its breadth of scientiﬁc and
technological importance. We exemplify these mixed stackings
in the hexagonal argyrodite material family through the
prediction and then isolation of the nontoxic and earth-
abundant Li6SiO4Cl2. Here, the resulting layer stacking gives
access to a disordered Li distribution, which is observed in fast
lithium-ion conductors, a distribution not accessible to its
nearest known cubic compositional counterpart, Li6PO5Cl.
Exploration of the many accessible mixed layer sequences and
associated site and chemical orderings aﬀorded within this
family opens new routes to the tuning and creation of ion
transport pathways through variation of both composition and
structure, as well as broader functional outcomes based on the
importance of the cubic argyrodite materials.

TRACT: A hexagonal analogue, Li6SiO4Cl2, of the cubic lithium
odite family of solid electrolytes is isolated by a computation−
riment approach. We show that the argyrodite structure is equivalent
e cubic antiperovskite solid electrolyte structure through anion site and
ncy ordering within a cubic stacking of two close-packed layers.
struction of models that assemble these layers with the combination of
gonal and cubic stacking motifs, both well known in the large family of
vskite structural variants, followed by energy minimization identifies Li6SiO4Cl2 as a stable candidate composition. Synthesis and
ture determination demonstrate that the material adopts the predicted lithium site-ordered structure with a low lithium
uctivity of ∼10 [−][10] S cm [−][1] at room temperature and the predicted hexagonal argyrodite structure above an order−disorder
ition at 469.3(1) K. This transition establishes dynamic Li site disorder analogous to that of cubic argyrodite solid electrolytes in
gonal argyrodite Li6SiO4Cl2 and increases Li-ion mobility observed via NMR and AC impedance spectroscopy. The
positional flexibility of both argyrodite and perovskite alongside this newly established structural connection, which enables the
of hexagonal and cubic stacking motifs, identifies a wealth of unexplored chemistry significant to the field of solid electrolytes.

disorder phase transition from static order (LT cubic phase) to
an extended dynamic disorder (HT cubic phase), with
delocalization of the lithium distribution. [8] In cubic oxide
analogues such as Li6PO5Br, this phase transition does not
occur, and lithium localization within the F4̅3m structure is
maintained over a wide temperature range (173−873 K). [9] In
the ordered F4̅3m structure of Li6PO5Br, lithium ions fully
occupy a single crystallographic 24g position. In the
dynamically disordered HT F4̅3m structure of the lithium
sulfide argyrodites, the additional available lithium sites
(Wyckoff position 48h) and extended diffusion of Li [+] are
linked to a dramatic increase in ionic conductivity by six orders
of magnitude. [10][,][11] The most highly conducting Li-containing
argyrodites are based on mixed sulfide−halide compositions,

̅

e.g., Li6PS5Br [6] and Li6.35P0.65Si0.35S5Br, in which Li [+] is
delocalized across 48h and 24g positions. [12]

The high-temperature F4̅3m argyrodite structure has
previously been described in terms of tetrahedral closepacking [1] or as localized pseudo-octahedral cages of A cations
surrounding one anion and separated by the other anions. [10][,][11]

his work, we establish a new relationship between the
tures of argyrodites and those of cubic antiperovskites,
h are themselves good conductors of lithium ions (i.e.,
Cl1−xBrx). [13] We extend this relationship, which provides a
ework for designing lithium-ion conductors, from cubic to
gonal antiperovskites and thus propose the lithium
gonal argyrodite family, computationally identifying
ral new compositional targets within this family.
O4Cl2 is then successfully synthesized following these
ictions based on mixed cubic and hexagonal stacking and
ws analogous dynamical cation site disorder to cubic
odites, which is required for Li transport.


XPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE


. Computational Methods. Periodic plane-wave-based
ty functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using
VASP code (version 5.4.4). [14] All calculations were performed
the projector-augmented wave method, [15] a plane-wave cutoff
y of 700 eV, and a k-point spacing of 0.15 Å [−][1] . Geometry
mization of both atomic positions and unit cell parameters was
nated once all forces fell below 0.001 eV Å [−][1] . The PBE
ional [16] was used to calculate relative energies and mechanical
erties, and the PBEsol functional [17] was used for direct
parison between computational and experimental crystal
ures. The convex hull of energies for all reported phases in
i−Si−O−Cl−Br and Li−Si−O−Cl−I phase fields was calculated
pymatgen. [18] Normal mode calculations were performed using
armonic approximation, with finite displacements of 0.01 Å and
ding distortions of the unit cell. This allowed the calculation of
c constants, including the bulk and shear moduli. [19] For
arison with existing compounds, the elastic constants of
Br (Pm3̅m structure) [20] and Li6PS5Br (Cc structure of

5 [I)][21][ were computed using the same method.]
2. Synthesis. 2.2.1. Materials. Li2CO3 (99.99%), SiO2 (silica
echnical grade, particle size 40−63 μm), and LiCl (&gt;99.0%) were
hased from Sigma-Aldrich.
.2. Synthesis of Li4SiO4. [22] Precursors were dried overnight at
K before weighing. Li2CO3 (1.2331 g,) and SiO2 (0.5013 g) were
hed according to the stoichiometric 2:1 ratio. The powders were
nd with an agate pestle and mortar for 15 min, placed into an
na crucible and heated in air to 1073 K at a ramp rate of 5 K
1, held at 1073 K for 12 h, and cooled at a ramp rate of 5 K
1. The resulting product was ground to obtain a fine powder,
h was then used as a precursor in the final synthesis step.
.3. Synthesis of Li6SiO4Cl2−xBrx. Li4SiO4, LiCl, and LiBr were
um-dried overnight (under 10 [−][4] mbar) before placing them in an
ed glovebox. All precursors and resulting powders were then
ed in an Ar-filled glovebox. LiCl, LiBr, and Li4SiO4 were mixed
e stoichiometric ratio, ground with an agate pestle and mortar for
in, and transferred to an alumina crucible. The crucible was
d in a silica tube, which was sealed under vacuum (&lt;10 [−][4] mbar).
ube was heated to 798 K at a ramp rate of 5 K min [−][1], held at 798
12 h, and cooled at a rate of 5 K min [−][1] . Once cooled, the silica
was opened inside the Ar glovebox, and the powder was ground
pestle and mortar for further characterization.
ngle crystals of Li6SiO4Cl2 were grown by mixing LiCl and
O4 in the stoichiometric ratio, heating the mixture to 883 K at a
rate of 5 K min [−][1], annealing it for 3 h, and slow cooling at 3 K

 - room temperature.
3. Powder X-ray Diffraction. Routine assessment of sample
y was carried out using a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer with
ochromatic Cu radiation (Kα1, λ = 1.54056 Å) in a Debye
rer transmission geometry with sample powders loaded into 0.5
borosilicate glass capillaries.
nchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) was performed at Diamond
Source U.K., on high-resolution beamline I11, [23] at λ = 0.826552
he pattern was recorded in transmission mode [0° &lt; 2θ &lt; 150°]
a multianalyzer crystal (MAC) detector. The sample was



introduced into a 1.0 mm diameter borosilicate glass capillary. The
experiment was performed at room temperature.
Synchrotron variable temperature X-ray diffraction (VT-XRD) was
performed in transmission mode using a position-sensitive detector
(PSD, λ = 0.82660 Å) on a sample, which was introduced into a 1.0
mm diameter silica capillary. The experiment was performed in the
temperature range of 298−798 K in 25 K steps on heating and then
cooled directly to room temperature to assess reversibility.
Rietveld refinements were carried out using TOPAS Academic. [24]

Initially, Pawley fits were performed on SXRD data, refining the lattice
parameters and the background using a Chebyshev function with 12
parameters. The peak shape was modeled using a pseudo-Voigt
function (high-temperature patterns) and a Thomson−Cox function
(room-temperature patterns). Refined parameters from final Pawley
fits were then used as starting points for Rietveld refinements where
the following parameters were refined: (1) scale factor, (2) atomic
coordinates, (3) isotropic (Li, Si, O) and anisotropic (Cl)
displacement parameters, and (4) atomic occupancies: the occupancies of Cl and O, and Li were refined, while the occupancy of the Si
site was set to the nominal value and the Li occupancies were set to
ensure charge compensation.
2.4. Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction. A twinned crystal was
examined with a Rigaku MicroMax-007 HF X-ray generator equipped
with a Mo Kα rotating-anode microfocus source and a Saturn 724+
detector. The data were collected at 100 K. Refinement of the cell
parameters, indexing of twin components, and reduction of the data
were performed on the obtained diffraction images with the use of the
software package CrysAlisPro. [25] The volume ratio of the twin
components was about 1:1. The degree of overlap of two components
is around 1%. The twin operator is 92.82° rotation around the −0.59
0.37 −0.72 reciprocal axis. The detwinned HKLF4 format file was
used for structure solution using Olex2. [26] The crystal structure was

̅ solved with the intrinsic phasing method provided by the ShelXT [27]

structure solution program. Refinements were carried out with the
ShelXL [28] refinement package using least-squares minimization.
2.5. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Heat flux
profiles were measured from 15.1 mg of powdered sample in a 40
μL aluminum crucible cold-welded under an Ar atmosphere (&lt;0.1
ppm O2, H2O) using a Netzsch DSC 404 F1 differential scanning
calorimeter. Data were recorded on heating to 823 K and then cooling
to 323 K using heating and cooling rates of 10 K min [−][1] under a
constant 50 mL min [−][1] flow of helium. The transition temperature is
the average of the values obtained from both the heating and cooling
curves, which were extracted through peak fitting.
2.6. Alternating current (AC) Impedance Spectroscopy and
Direct Current (DC) Polarization. A pellet of Li6SiO4Cl2 was made
by uniaxially pressing ∼30 mg of material in an 8 mm cylindrical steel
die at a pressure of 125 MPa. The pellet was sintered in an evacuated,
flame-dried silica tube for 12 h at 848 K. Using this method, a relative
density of 84% was achieved.
AC impedance measurements were conducted using an impedance
analyzer (Keysight impedance analyzer E4990A). A sputtered gold
coating of 300 nm thickness was used as the ion blocking electrodes.
Sputtering was achieved under an argon atmosphere using a Q150R
sputter coater, and temperature-dependent conductivity measurements were performed under an argon atmosphere over a frequency
range of 2 MHz to 20 Hz (with an amplitude of 100 mV).
Measurements were performed in the temperature range of 333−575
K in 20 K steps. The ZView2 program [29] was used to fit the impedance
spectra with an equivalent circuit.
A pellet of 84% relative density was used for DC potentiation
polarization measurements. DC polarization data was collected at 300
°C on a Au|Li6SiO4Cl2|Au symmetric cell by applying constant
potentials of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 V for 7200 s and monitoring the
current variation with time. Once a constant current was achieved, the
current was recorded and plotted against the applied voltage allowing
for the electronic conductivity (σe) to be extracted from the following
equation

associated with a 10% Li deficiency were also performed for all
models investigated and found to have negligible impact in the
resulting electron density distributions. All MEM results were
visualized in the VESTA crystal structure visualization software. [36]


3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION


3.1. Selection of Target Compounds by Structural
Analogy between Argyrodite and Perovskite. We
describe the relationship between the argyrodite structure,
exemplified by Li6PO5Br (Figure 1a), and the cubic
antiperovskite structure. In analogy with perovskites of general
formula ABX3, Li6PO5Br can be written as [((PO4)0.5Br0.5)(O0.5□0.5)Li3]2, where □ is a vacancy. As such, Li6PO5Br
could be considered as an inverse double perovskite. When
viewed as a cubic antiperovskite, the lithium ions in Li6PO5Br
replace the anion positions in the conventional cubic
perovskite (e.g., SrTiO3; [37] Figure 1b). The phosphate
polyanions and bromide anions replace the larger A-site
cations in a rock-salt-ordered fashion. As the cubic perovskite
can be represented as a cubic close-packed stacking of AX3
layers along [111], here the cubic stacking is an alternation of
Li3Br and Li3PO4 layers that produces the rock-salt anion
ordering. The remaining, isolated oxide anions, then occupy
half of the octahedral B-site positions between these layers also
in an ordered manner, leaving the other half of the B-sites
vacant. The P−O bond vector of each tetrahedral (PO4) [3][−]
anion is directed toward the vacant B-sites, coupling the rocksalt order of the two A-site anions to the anion vacancy defect
ordering on the B-site. Rock-salt order of 50% B-site vacancies
occurs in the structure of well-known K2PtCl638 (Figure 1c).

When considering these structural similarities between the
lithium argyrodites and the lithium antiperovskites, it is evident
that the lithium sites in both structures are topologically
equivalent. As a result, both structures share the same network
of connectivity between lithium sites (Figure 1d,e), suggesting
that the underlying mechanism for high ionic conductivity is

mperature calibrations were performed using the chemical shift
mometers Pb(NO3)2 using [207] Pb NMR [31] and by monitoring the

ysis of these structures shows that they contain similar
-packed layers to those present in the cubic antiperovskite
ription of the argyrodite family, but that, instead of a −c−
−b−c−) close-packed stacking, they are stacked in a
c−h−c− (−a−b−a−c−) manner, as would occur in a
gonal antiperovskite. Different close-packed layer stacking
fs are known within the antiperovskites. [44] The argyrodite/
c antiperovskite structural relationship suggests that Liaining materials based on the hexagonal, rather than cubic,
erovskite stacking of these layers, related to the hexagonal
tures of Cu8GeSe6 and Ag5PS4I2, would be analogous to
ithium-containing argyrodites, where the number of Li
and extent of Li ordering among them control ionic
uctivity.
arting from the cubic Li6PO5X (X = Cl, Br) argyrodites,

his is a hexagonal analogue of the Li6PO5Br structure
ribed previously and an inverse analogue of the 4Hgonal perovskites (e.g., 4H-BaMnO3, [46] stacking sequence
c−h−c (−a−b−a−c−); Figure 2b). These hexagonal Li
odites contain similar close-packed AX3 layers to the
c argyrodites (i.e., alternating Li3Br and Li3PO4/Li3SiO4

3.2. Synthesis, Thermal Behavior, and Structure
Determination. Compounds were synthesized as powders
with compositions Li6SiO4Cl2−xBrx (x = 0, 0.5,1) to explore
the computationally predicted targets. Synthesis of powders
was attempted at varying reaction temperatures (50 K steps
from 723 to 873 K) and reaction times (12, 24, 48 h), and
starting materials and resulting powders were handled under an
argon atmosphere and annealed in alumina crucibles in
evacuated silica ampoules (Section 2.2). Synthesis at 823 K
for 48 h yielded phase-pure powders for Li6SiO4Cl2. This new
phase persists in the compositional range Li6SiO4Cl2−xBrx (0 ≥
x ≥ 1) and displays increased lattice parameters as a function
[of bromine content (Figure S1). Despite this clear indication](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c00157/suppl_file/cm1c00157_si_001.pdf)
of anion substitution, all compositions with x &gt; 0 contained
impurities; only Li6SiO4Cl2 was synthesized as a phase-pure
white powder, and as such, all further discussion therefore
concerns Li6SiO4Cl2. Single crystals of Li6SiO4Cl2 were
synthesized by annealing at 883 K for 3 h before slow cooling
(3 K h [−][1] ) to room temperature. High-resolution synchrotron
XRD data (SXRD) were collected on the powder from 298 to
798 K in 25 K steps. At temperatures 473−498 K, convergence
of some peaks and disappearance of other small peaks indicate
a phase transition to a high-temperature, higher-symmetry
phase (denoted HT phase) (Figure 4a,b). This transition is
also observed in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data
measured from Li6SiO4Cl2 powder, which shows endothermic
and exothermic events on heating and cooling, respectively,
associated with this reversible phase transition (Figure 4c).
The exact transition temperature determined from DSC data is
469.3(1) K, consistent with the observations from SXRD,
NMR, and AC impedance measurements (see below).
Similarly to the RT phase, the experimental SXRD pattern of
the HT phase could not be indexed to any known compounds
in the Li−Si−O−Cl phase field. The structure of the RT phase
was solved by single-crystal (SC) X-ray diffraction and the HT
phase by the Rietveld refinement of a computed starting model
against high-resolution SXRD data.
3.2.1. Room-Temperature Phase: Structure Determination. The crystal structure was solved in the space group Pna21
from a nonmerohedrally twinned crystal with lattice parameters: a = 10.5204(8) Å, b = 6.0756(4) Å, and c = 9.9530(7) Å.
The assignments of Li, Si, O, and Cl were determined based on
interatomic distances and relative displacement parameters. All
atomic positions were refined with fixed fully occupied sites.
Lithium atoms exhibited nonpositive definite anisotropic mean
square displacements, so ISOR restraints were applied to
atoms Li1−6 during the final refinement and also to atoms

composition is Li5.957(2)Si1.00O3.986(2)Cl1.985(1), and the RT
phase will therefore be denoted RT-Li6SiO4Cl2 hereafter for
simplicity.
3.2.2. Room-Temperature Phase: Structure Description.
As described in Section 3.1, the orthorhombic structure arises
from the rotation of lithium atoms off the mirror plane in
P63mc through activation of Γ5 and M2 modes, stabilizing the
Pna21 symmetry. This leads to a change in anionic and cationic
coordination environments compared to the hexagonal defect
antiperovskite parent.
The experimentally determined RT structure is shown in
Figure 5a, highlighting the atomic packing within the structure
defined by alternating Li3SiO4 and Li3Cl layers. Comparison of
the experimentally determined Pna21 structure to the
computed structure shows almost identical atomic positions
[(Figure S7a). The chloride ions that occupy 50% of the](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c00157/suppl_file/cm1c00157_si_001.pdf)
antiperovskite B-site positions (Cl1) are found in an octahedral
environment with bond lengths ranging from 2.415(3) to
2.621(3) Å to neighboring Li. Compared to the idealized
octahedral environment expected for B-site anions in
antiperovskites, the octahedra are distorted slightly as a result
of the nonrigid rotation of Li ions and the displacement of
chlorine toward neighboring vacant B-sites. The chloride ions
that occupy 50% of the A-site (Cl2), typically forming
cuboctahedral (12-fold) coordination environments in hexagonal perovskites such as 4H-BaMnO3, occupy a distorted
octahedral environment in the orthorhombic polymorph with
[bond lengths from 2.446(3) to 2.798(7) Å (Figure S8). All](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c00157/suppl_file/cm1c00157_si_001.pdf)
lithium atoms are found in tetrahedral LiCl2O2 coordination
environments. Due to the difference in ionic radii (rCl = 1.81 Å,
rO = 1.40 Å), [45] lithium atoms are displaced toward the oxygen
atoms (Figure 5c). Li−O bond lengths vary from 1.829(3) to
1.931(3) Å, comparable to distances reported for the cubic
argyrodite Li6PO5Cl (1.93 Å) [9] and shorter than Li−O bonds
in Li4SiO4 (1.84−2.51 Å). [49] Li−Cl bond lengths range from
2.415(3) to 2.798(3) Å. These values are larger than expected
for typical LiCl4 bond lengths, e.g., 2.38 Å in Li2MgCl4. [50] The
difference in bond lengths compared to homoleptic LiCl4 and
LiO4 tetrahedral environments is expected in heteroleptic
LiCl2O2 and optimizes the bond valence sum for Li [+] (BVS:
0.939(8)−1.12(1)). The Li−Cl distances in Li6SiO4Cl2 are
shorter than in the cubic oxide argyrodite Li6PO5Cl (2.910(4)
Å), in which Li atoms have a trigonal bipyramidal coordination
(LiO3Cl2) with Cl occupying the axial positions. [9]

In the RT structure, LiCl2O2 tetrahedra are connected
through the corner-sharing of Cl and O vertices and the
sharing of Cl−Cl edges; they are referred to using the central
lithium atom, i.e., Li(1)O2Cl2 as a Li1 tetrahedron. Edgesharing between Li1−Li3 and Li4−Li6 tetrahedra is facilitated
by the lithium-ion displacements away from the shared Cl−Cl
edges (Figure 6a,c), minimizing electrostatic repulsions.
The Li3SiO4 layer can be described (Figure 6a) as
alternating corner-sharing Li2−Li3 and Li1−SiO4 chains

via activation of occupational M2 and Γ5 modes, with a small

HT P63mc structure can be described as a 4H-hexagonal
erovskite of general formula ABX3, with structural
arities to 4H-BaMnO3 (Figure 2b) in which half of the
es are vacant. This is consistent with cation-deficient
gonal perovskites with the formula A2BX6, such as
MnF6 with the P63mc symmetry. [51] The HT structure of
O4Cl2, consisting of alternating hexagonally stacked Li3Cl
Li3SiO4 layers, is shown in Figure 5b. The (poly)anion
ork in the HT structure remains unchanged through the

̅


The order−disorder transition of Li6SiO4Cl2 (Figure 5c,d) is
similar to the behavior of many argyrodites; Cu8GeSe6 displays
an order−disorder transition between P63cm and P63mc
structures, where Cu ions are disordered in the latter similarly
to Li on the 6c and 12d Wyckoff positions in Li6SiO4Cl2, [39][,][54]

and analogous behavior is observed in silver-containing
argyrodites. [1] Specifically, cubic Li6PS5I has ordered lithium
positions at low temperature (&lt;180 K) and a disordered
structure at 298 K in which lithium is delocalized across the
24g and 48h positions (Figure 5e), [21] resulting in comparable
local lithium coordination environments with Li6SiO4Cl2
(Figure 5c,d) that are consistent with dynamical disorder.
This is distinct from the cubic oxide argyrodite, Li6PO5Br, in
which lithium remains localized on the trigonal planar 24g
Wyckoff position in the F4̅3m structure over a wide (173−873
K) temperature range (Figure 1e). [48] Stabilization of this
lithium disorder, which enables access to higher-energy sites in
Li6SiO4Cl2, would increase lithium-ion migration compared
against the room-temperature structure.
3.3. Transport Properties. The ionic conductivity of
Li6SiO4Cl2 was investigated through AC impedance spectroscopy on a sintered white pellet of ∼84% theoretical density
(pellet cold-pressed under 125 MPa and sintered in an
evacuated silica ampoule for 12 h at 848 K). A typical set of
data measured at 533 K in an inert atmosphere are shown in
Figure 7a. The impedance complex plane plots, Z*, consist of a
high-frequency arc with the presence of a small low-frequency
inclined spike. The large single arc is attributed to the sample
bulk, as shown by overlapping peaks in the combined Z″/M″
[spectra (Figure S12a). The associated capacitance of the high-](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c00157/suppl_file/cm1c00157_si_001.pdf)
frequency arc, 0.6 pF cm [−][1], corresponding to a permittivity of
[∼6.8, is also consistent with the grain response (Figure S12b).](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c00157/suppl_file/cm1c00157_si_001.pdf)
The low-frequency spike is attributed to the double-layer
capacitance at the blocking sample−electrode interface, where
Li ions cannot pass. To a first approximation, the highfrequency arc could be modeled with an equivalent circuit
consisting of a resistor in parallel with a constant phase
element (CPE). Impedance data were fitted to the equivalent
circuit using ZView software (Figure 7a). In general, the
material is homogeneous and shows a total conductivity of 6.2
× 10 [−][6] S cm [−][1] at 575 K and ∼10 [−][10] S cm [−][1] at room
temperature. DC polarization measurements show a low
electronic contribution of &gt;0.5% at 300 °C to the overall
[conductivity (eq 1 and Figure S13). From the low-frequency](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c00157/suppl_file/cm1c00157_si_001.pdf)
intercept of the impedance arc on the Z′ axis, the values of the
total resistance were obtained and are shown in an Arrhenius
format in Figure 7b. A change in slope can be observed above

es) and the hexagonal phase (black squares) have
ation energies of 0.560(8) and 0.444(9) eV, respectively.
he local ionic mobility of lithium was investigated through
olid-state NMR. The temperature dependence of the static
NMR spectra of Li6SiO4Cl2 over the temperature range of
−593 K is shown in Figure 7c. At temperatures where ion
ility is minimal, i.e., the rigid lattice regime, the 1/2 ↔
2 central transition is broadened by the 7Li−7Li
onuclear dipolar coupling. For Li6SiO4Cl2, this region is
een 350 and 450 K, where the line width of the central
ition is ∼5.5 kHz. As the temperature is increased above
K, the line width decreases drastically over a small
erature range (Figure 7d) due to the increasing motion of
Li spins continuously averaging the dipolar interactions
clearly evidences an increase in ionic mobility facilitated by ̅
hase transition from the ordered RT-orthorhombic to the
er-symmetry HT-hexagonal phase.
hrough calculation of the strength of [7] Li− [7] Li homonuclear
ar coupling of both the room-temperature and higherature phases of Li6SiO4Cl2, further insight into the local
dynamics of the two phases can be determined. By
cting the shortest Li−Li distance from the SXRD data
−Li5, 2.697(6) Å), the absolute value of the dipolar
ling constant can be calculated (eq 2) as ∼5.8 kHz in RTO4Cl2 in full agreement with the experimental line width



observed, while ∼8.2 kHz is obtained from Li1a and Li2
(2.410(5) Å) for HT-Li6SiO4Cl2. Due to the increase in
dipolar coupling after the phase transition, it would be
expected that [7] Li spectra demonstrate increased line widths
at higher T in the absence of an increase in Li-ion mobility.
However, the line narrowing observed (Figure 7d) is a clear
indication that the phase transition from the RT-orthorhombic
phase to the higher-symmetry HT-hexagonal phase facilitates
an increase in Li-ion mobility, as also observed in AC
impedance measurements (Figure 7b). The delocalization of
lithium in HT-Li6SiO4Cl2 across the 6c and 12d sites (Figure
5c,d) results in a lowering of the activation energy from RTLi6SiO4Cl2 where the lithium positions are fully ordered. The
activation energies obtained from Li6SiO4Cl2 are lower than
those extracted from Li6PO5Cl across the measured temperature range, despite the latter adopting the higher-symmetry
cubic F4̅3m structure. [9]

The distinction between the oxide materials Li6SiO4Cl2 and
Li6PO5Cl is likely the increased size of the trigonal anion
window (Figure 5f) and the associated dynamical Li disorder
(absent in cubic Li6PO5Cl, where Li is localized on the 24g
position) in hexagonal Li6SiO4Cl2 (partial occupancy of 6c and
12d positions by Li), leading to lower activation energies for
ion mobility. Local jumps of Li [+] between these tetrahedral sites
separated by the trigonal anion windows are the most favorable
for ionic diffusion in argyrodites. [8] Occupational disorder via
chalcogenide−halide mixing on the anion position that forms

ases the size of this window, further lowering the
ation energy of ion transport compared to Li6PO5Cl.


ONCLUSIONS


connection between argyrodite and antiperovskite
tures is established, thus identifying close-packed layers
can be assembled through the diversity of combined
gonal and cubic stacking operations known to give the
vskite material family its breadth of scientific and
nological importance. We exemplify these mixed stackings
he hexagonal argyrodite material family through the
iction and then isolation of the nontoxic and earthdant Li6SiO4Cl2. Here, the resulting layer stacking gives
s to a disordered Li distribution, which is observed in fast
um-ion conductors, a distribution not accessible to its
est known cubic compositional counterpart, Li6PO5Cl.
oration of the many accessible mixed layer sequences and
ciated site and chemical orderings afforded within this
y opens new routes to the tuning and creation of ion
port pathways through variation of both composition and
ture, as well as broader functional outcomes based on the
rtance of the cubic argyrodite materials.

ABSTRACT: Lithium-ion conducting argyrodites have recently attracted signiﬁcant
interest as solid electrolytes for solid-state battery applications. In order to enhance the
utility of materials in this class, a deeper understanding of the fundamental structure−
property relationships is still required. Using Rietveld reﬁnements of X-ray diﬀraction
data and pair distribution function analysis of neutron diﬀraction data, coupled with
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and speed of sound measurements, the
structure and transport properties within Li6PS5−xSexBr (0 ≤x ≤1) have been
monitored with increasing Se content. While it has been previously suggested that the
incorporation of larger, more polarizable anions within the argyrodite lattice should lead
to enhancements in the ionic conductivity, the Li6PS5−xSexBr transport behavior was
found to be largely unaﬀected by the incorporation of Se2−due to signiﬁcant structural
modiﬁcations to the anion sublattice. This work aﬃrms the notion that, when
optimizing the ionic conductivity of solid ion conductors, local structural inﬂuences
cannot be ignored and the idea of “the softer the lattice, the better” does not always
hold true.
1. INTRODUCTION
Over the past few years, solid ion conductors have garnered
considerable attention due to their potential as separators in
solid-state lithium-ion-battery applications.1−3 The employ-
ment of solid electrolytes possessing high ionic conductivities,
thereby replacing the ubiquitous liquid electrolytes used in
conventional lithium-ion batteries, enables the realization of
safer and more reliable batteries with higher energy and power
densities. Among the myriad of solid electrolytes that are
currently available, the class of lithium thiophosphates have
been found to exhibit some of the most exceptional ionic
conductivities, e.g., Li10MP2S12,4−11 Li7P3S11,12−14 thiophos-
phate glass ceramics,15−19 and the Li6PS5X argyrodites,20−24
among others.25 Nevertheless, a better understanding of the
principles governing ionic transport in solid ion conductors is
still required in order to access the next generation of
electrolyte materials.
Figure 1a shows the fully ordered unit cell of the Li6PCh5Br
(Ch = chalcogenide) argyrodite structure. Therein, the corner
and face-centered positions of the cubic lattice (Wyckoﬀ4a)
are occupied by the Br−anions. Meanwhile, the PCh4
polyhedra reside on the octahedral sites (with P on Wyckoﬀ
4b) and the tetrahedral voids are partially occupied by the free
chalcogenide anions (Wyckoﬀ4d). Importantly, a high degree
of site disorder between Br−and Ch2−in Li6PS5Br is known to
exist and has been shown to inﬂuence the ionic conductiv-
ity.20,26 As shown in Figure 1b, the chemical identity of the
anion framework surrounding the mobile lithium ions
signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the associated diﬀusion. The available
sites for the lithium ions (Wyckoﬀ48h and 24g) form cage-like
polyhedra around the free chalcogenide anions, enabling three
diﬀerent jump processes to occur during ionic transport:
lithium ion jumps between neighboring lithium positions
(48h−24g−48h; doublet jump), intracage jumps (48h−48h),
and intercage jumps (48h−48h), as shown in Figure 1b.
In this work, the substitution of S2−by Se2−was performed
within Li6PS5−xSexBr (0 ≤x ≤1) in order to assess the
inﬂuence of incorporating a larger, more polarizable anion
upon the free sulfur site 4d on the resultant structure and
lithium transport behavior, while maintaining the existing
diﬀusion pathways. The goal of this study is twofold: (1) The
incorporation of larger and less electronegative atoms has been
predicted to enhance the ionic conductivity.24 In theory,
incorporating larger, more polarizable anions in the argyrodite
lattice should broaden the lithium diﬀusion pathways and
weaken interactions between Li+ and the anion framework due
to changing lattice dynamics, leading to an increase in the
associated ionic conductivity. (2) In addition, by substituting
only the free chalcogen site, it may be possible to alter the
known site disorder between Br−and Ch2−.
Using a combination of X-ray diﬀraction, neutron pair
distribution function, impedance spectroscopy, and ultrasonic
sound response measurements, this work shows that, in the
Li6PS5−xSexBr system, the potential for structural changes that
alter the interactions between the mobile Li+ atoms and the

anion framework complicates this conductivity enhancement
strategy. While the larger anion broadens the lithium diﬀusion
pathways, a local structural reordering and loss of site disorder
counters the beneﬁcial, wider diﬀusion pathways. In addition,
the changing lattice dynamics aﬀect the activation energy and
prefactor, as they are decreased for the compounds with a
softer lattice. This work shows the importance of local
structural considerations in the development of ionic
conductivity enhancement strategies and that “the softer the
lattice, the better” does not always apply.
2. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
Synthesis. All preparations and sample treatments were carried
out under an Ar atmosphere. Lithium sulﬁde (Li2S, Sigma-Aldrich,
99.98%), lithium bromide (LiBr, ChemPur, 99.995%), P (ChemPur,
99.999%), S (Acros Organics, 99.999%), and Se (Alfa Aesar,
99.999%) were mixed in the appropriate stoichiometric ratios using
an agate mortar. The precursor mixtures were pressed into pellets and
sealed in quartz ampules (10 mm inner diameter and 10−12 cm in
length) under vacuum. All ampules were carbon-coated and preheated
at 800 °C under dynamic vacuum for 3 h to avoid all traces of water in
the reaction atmosphere. The reaction mixtures were treated at 550
°C for 2 weeks to ensure reaction completeness and the phase purity
of the products.
X-ray Powder Diﬀraction. Powder X-ray diﬀraction measure-
ments were carried out using an Empyrean diﬀractometer
(PANalytical, Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation (λ1 = 1.54051 Å,
λ2 = 1.54433 Å) in Bragg−Brentano θ−θ geometry using a PIXcel3D
area detector with 255 measuring channels. Samples were pulverized
and placed on (911)-oriented silicon zero diﬀraction holders and
sealed with Kapton foil. Measurements have been performed within a
2θ range of 10−90° with a step size of 0.026° and 180 s per step.
Rietveld Analysis. Rietveld reﬁnements were carried out using
the TOPAS software package.27 The peak proﬁle shape was described
by a pseudo-Voigt function using the modiﬁed Thomson−Cox−
Hastings setting. Fit indicators: Rwp, Rexp, and GoF were used to assess
the quality of the reﬁned structural models. The following parameters
were initially reﬁned: (1) scale factor, (2) background coeﬃcients, (3)
peak shape, (4) lattice constants, (5) fractional atomic coordinates of
the sulfur atoms on the Wyckoﬀ16e site, (6) isotropic atomic
displacement parameters, and (7) sample displacement. The Se
content was ﬁxed to the nominal value for all reﬁnements, given the
strong agreement with the experimental stoichiometry determined by
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Figure S1 and Table S1). In
addition, as X-rays are not able to resolve the lithium occupancies,
these values were ﬁxed on the basis of previously obtained structural
data extracted from neutron diﬀraction data of Li6PS5Br.20 The
atomic occupancies of S and Se on the Wyckoﬀ16e position were
reﬁned in order to quantify the exchange between S and Se on the
Wyckoﬀ4a and 16e positions. Finally, atomic occupancies of Br and S
were reﬁned in order to quantify the anion site disorder in
Li6PS5−xSexBr (x = 0, 0.1, and 0.2) between Br (Wyckoﬀ4a) and S
(Wyckoﬀ4d). Beyond this range of Se incorporation, the similar
electron densities of Se and Br inhibited the deconvolution of the Br−
/S2−exchange on the Wyckoﬀ4d and 4a sites, respectively.
Neutron Pair Distribution Function Analysis. Quartz capil-
laries with an outer diameter of 0.9 mm were ﬁlled in an argon
glovebox and sealed using epoxy. Neutron scattering data suitable for
pair distribution function analysis were collected at room temperature
using the TOF NOMAD instrument at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory beamline (Oak Ridge, TN).
The crystallographic data, obtained from the reﬁnements of the
Bragg data, were used as starting values for the analysis of the PDF
data of Li6PS5−xSexBr (x = 0, 0.5, 1.0). The pair distribution function
G(r) was employed for a more accurate structural analysis, and the
Oak Ridge software was used to extract G(r) from the raw diﬀraction
data. A maximum scattering vector (Qmax) of 22 Å−1 was employed in
the Fourier transform. Structural reﬁnements were carried out using
the PDFgui software.28 The local crystal structure of the
Li6PS5−xSexBr crystallites was reﬁned with the F4̅3m space group.
The ﬁt of this structural model to the experimental PDF data was
performed in the 1.8−30 Å interatomic distance range. The following
parameters were reﬁned: (1) scale factor, (2) lattice constants, (3)
local correlated motion factor, (4) fractional atomic coordinates of the
lithium atoms and the sulfur atoms on the Wyckoﬀ16e site, and (5)
atomic isotropic displacement parameters. The Se content was ﬁxed
to the nominal content for all reﬁnements, given the strong agreement
with the experimental stoichiometry determined by energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (Figure S1 and Table S1). The atomic
occupancies of S and Se on the Wyckoﬀ16e position were reﬁned
in order to quantify the exchange between S and Se on the Wyckoﬀ
4a and 16e positions. Finally, atomic occupancies of Br, S, and Se
were reﬁned in order to quantify the anion site disorder between Br
(Wyckoﬀ4a) and S/Se (Wyckoﬀ4d). The Rw indicator was
employed to assess the quality of the reﬁned structural models.
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. Electrical con-
ductivities were measured by AC impedance spectroscopy, using
isostatically pressed pellets (325 MPa, 3.0 mm thickness, 9.5 mm
diameter, geometric density of all samples &gt;83%) that have been
rapidly annealed at 550 °C for 10 min in an evacuated quartz ampule
and were afterward gold coated with thin gold (200 nm) electrodes.
Electrochemical impedance analysis was conducted in the temper-
ature range 233−333 K using an SP300 impedance analyzer
(Biologic) at frequencies from 7 MHz to 100 mHz with an amplitude
of 10 mV.
Ultrasonic Speed of Sound Measurements. Pulse-echo speed
of sound measurements were performed on consolidated discs using
an Epoch 600 (Olympus) with 5 MHz transducers for longitudinal
and transverse speeds of sound The samples were coated with a thin
Figure 1. (a) Ordered crystal structure of Li6PCh5Br. The Br−anions form a cubic close packed lattice with PCh4 tetrahedra in the octahedral sites
and the free Ch2−in half of the tetrahedral sites (Wyckoﬀ4d). (b) The Li positions form localized cages in which multiple jump processes are
possible. Jumps between the lithium positions (48h−24g−48h; doublet jump), intracage jumps (48h−48h), and intercage jumps (48h−48h) can
occur.

--------------------------------------------------
couplant and the sample. All measurements were performed under a
nitrogen atmosphere. The measurement uncertainty from the speed of
sound data results stems from the uncertainty in the thickness and the
porosity. As the measurement uncertainty for the thickness of the
pellet is much higher than that of the gold layer, the thin layer of Au is
not expected to add signiﬁcantly to the measurement uncertainty. In
addition, no damping of the signal is expected due to the high
crystallinity and high speed of sound in Au. This measurement
procedure has recently been shown to be successful in understanding
the lattice softness of thiophosphates.20,29−31

3. RESULTS
Structural Characterization. The Li+ superionic argyr-
odites Li6PS5−xSexBr (0 ≤x ≤1) have been synthesized in
order to study the inﬂuence of (1) increasing the anion
polarizability and (2) replacing the free S2−site with Se2−on
both the structure and the transport properties. In the case of
(1), the replacement of sulfur with the larger and more
polarizable selenium is expected to aﬀect the lattice dynamics
and expand the unit cell volume, both of which should in turn
aﬀect the ionic transport.24,31,34 In the case of (2), site disorder
between the free S2−(Wyckoﬀ4d) and Br−(Wyckoﬀ4a) has
been shown to aﬀect the activation barrier for ionic motion,20
as it controls the bottleneck of the intercage jumps, in which
more site disorder seems to be beneﬁcial for the long-range
transport. In addition, it was recently shown that the X−/S2−
site disorder decreases when the size mismatch between the
sulfur and the halide anions increases.20
To take a closer look at the structural inﬂuences of Se
incorporation on the resultant argyrodite structure, Rietveld
reﬁnements of powder X-ray diﬀraction patterns were
performed. Additionally, due to the low X-ray form factor of
Li+, as well as the nearly identical electron densities of Br−and
Se2−, and with it their scattering form factor for X-rays, selected
samples (x = 0, 0.5, 1.0) were also investigated using neutron
pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. Employment of a
neutron PDF analysis aﬀords more accurate structural
information concerning both the changing Li+ substructure
and the Br−/Ch2−site disorder.
Figure 2 shows an exemplary Rietveld reﬁnement of the X-
ray diﬀraction data and the PDF analysis of neutron diﬀraction
data for Li6PS4.5Se0.5Br. As can be seen from a visual inspection
of the ﬁts and the corresponding quality-of-ﬁt parameters, the
herein studied samples are well described by the cubic F4̅3m
argyrodite structure. It should be noted that all compounds
exhibit minor impurity phase fractions of LiBr and Li3OBr (&lt;5
wt %), independent of Se content. Nevertheless, the impurities
are unlikely to aﬀect the ionic transport or the obtained
structural data,20,21 which can be found tabulated in the
Supporting Information (Tables S2−S15).
The relevant structural data extracted from reﬁnements
against the X-ray diﬀraction data and neutron PDF are
provided in Figure 3. The lattice parameters, and thus the unit
cell volumes increase linearly with increasing Se content
thereby obeying Vegard’s law and conﬁrming the successful
synthesis of solid solutions within the Li6PS5−xSexBr (0 ≤x ≤
1) series. The observed lattice expansion is induced by the
larger ionic radius of Se2−(1.98 Å) relative to S2−(1.84 Å).35
Within the argyrodite structure, the chalcogenide anions either
coordinate with P5+ to form PCh4
3−tetrahedra or occupy the
free Ch2−sites (Wyckoﬀ16e or 4d, respectively). Interestingly,
with increasing x, beyond the increase in the occupancy of the
Wyckoﬀ4d site (i.e., the free Ch2−site), an increase in the
occupancy of the Wyckoﬀ16e site by Se can also be seen
(Figure 3b). This increasing occupancy of Se on the tetrahedra
drives the observed expansion of the PCh4 tetrahedra (Figure
3c). At the composition of Li6PS4SeBr, approximately 50% of
the selenium occupy the free Ch2−site, with the other half
replacing sulfur on the PS4
3−tetrahedra. The increasing
occupancy of the 16e site by Se was further corroborated by
Raman spectroscopy (Figure S2). Here, as the occupancy of
the 16e site by Se increases, the formation of PS3Se3−
tetrahedra breaks the tetrahedral symmetry of the PCh4 units
and augments the intensity of the symmetric stretching mode
at 367 cm−1 with increasing x.
As described above, site disorder between Br−and the
chalcogenide anions is also known to occur,20,22,26 in which the
free chalcogenide anions exchange with Br−to additionally
occupy the Wyckoﬀ4a sites. Figure 3d shows the obtained
disorder between Br−and Ch2−, and the percentage of disorder
shown represents the total fraction of Br−on the Ch2−site.
Given the similar X-ray scattering form factors of Br−and Se2−,
only exchange between Br−and S2−was reﬁned from the X-ray
scattering data for x = 0, 0.1, and 0.2. Beyond this
compositional range, the reﬁnement of the site disorder was
unstable due to the increasing Se content and the diﬃculty in
distinguishing Br−and Se2−. Fortunately, Br and Se are
distinguishable by neutron diﬀraction, and thus, both types of
exchange (i.e., S2−and Se2−) with Br−could be adequately
reﬁned for x = 0, 0.5, and 1.0 using the neutron pair
distribution function data. There are no unexpected variations
in the local structure, as seen in the G(r), and a good
agreement can be found between the reﬁned X-ray and
neutron diﬀraction data, where the obtained disorder for
Li6PS5Br was approximately 23% and rapidly decreases with
increasing Se content. While the reﬁned site disorder in
Li6PS5Br conﬁrms the values found by Kraft et al.20 and
Minafra et al.,21 the decreasing disorder remains puzzling.

--------------------------------------------------
larger anion size mismatch between the halide X−and S2−
leads to a decreasing site disorder in Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I). In
the here presented case of replacing S2−with Se2−, however,
the opposite is true. With decreasing size mismatch (r(Se2−) =
1.98 Å, r(S2−) = 1.84 Å, and r(Br−) = 1.96 Å), the site disorder
decreases.35 While the underlying reason for the opposite trend
in the evolution of the site disorder remains unknown, it may
be related to the substitution of S2−by Se2−on the 16e
position and, with it, the formation of local PS3Se3−tetrahedra.
Considering Figure 4d, local changes in the tetrahedra may
strongly aﬀect the local ordering of the anions. Furthermore,
the absence of site disorder coupled with the small size
mismatch between S2−, Se2−, and Br−suggests that more subtle
electronic structure eﬀects may also be inﬂuencing the site
disorder. Nevertheless, as site disorder is known to inﬂuence
the ionic transport, i.e., hindering the intercage jumps at low
levels of disorder or in the absence of disorder,20,26 an
inﬂuence on the Li+ distribution and ionic transport in the
herein studied solid solutions can be expected.
Figure 4 shows the eﬀect of Se substitution on the Li+
sublattice in Li6PS5−xSexBr (x = 0, 0.5, 1.0), as obtained from
the PDF analysis of the neutron diﬀraction data. With
increasing Se content, the lithium occupancy on the 48h
Wyckoﬀsite can be seen to increase, with a concurrent
decrease in the occupancy of the 24g transition state (Figure
4a). Considering the coordination of Li+ (48h) around the free
Ch2−site, forming clusters of lithium (Figure 1b), one may
expect that the reduced site disorder, and with it the higher
charge density of Ch2−vs Br−leads to a higher occupancy of
Li+ on the 48h site. The higher occupancy on the 48h site leads
to more Coulombic repulsion between these two sites, which
concurrently increases the doublet jump distance 48h−24g−
48h and decreases the intercage jump (see Figure 4b). While
the occupancies of the diﬀerent positions change, there seems
to be no signiﬁcant change in the Li positions to suggest
altered diﬀusion trajectories, in accordance with the work by
Kraft et al.20 In addition to the Li+ occupancies and jump
distances, the width of the diﬀusion pathway is important in
ionic conductors.30,36 The Li ions on the Wyckoﬀ48h position
are coordinated by three Ch2−and one Br−, forming LiCh3Br
tetrahedra. Meanwhile, the Li ions on the Wyckoﬀ24g position
are coordinated by three sulfur, forming a trigonal planar LiS3
arrangement, and correspond to the transition state between
the doublet jumps.20 Depictions of the polyhedra and planes
along the conduction pathway, in addition to the variation in
the polyhedral volumes and planar areas with changing
composition, are provided in Figure 4c and d. With increasing
Se content, the unit cell increases and the lithium diﬀusion
pathways also broaden.
Ionic Transport. Temperature-dependent electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy was performed on all samples to
monitor the changes in the ionic conductivity in Li6PS5−xSexBr
with respect to the Se content. For clarity, only representative
Arrhenius plots (x = 0, 0.5, 1.0) and a ﬁtted impedance
response for Li6PS4.5Se0.5Br are provided in Figure 5a and b,
respectively. At lower temperatures, the impedance data were
ﬁtted with an equivalent circuit consisting of two parallel CPE/
resistors in series with a CPE representing blocking electrodes

--------------------------------------------------
(Figure 5b, inset). At temperatures &gt;263 K, the ionic
conductivity and relaxation times are so fast and shifted to
higher frequencies that they cannot be resolved within the
frequency range of the employed impedance analyzer.
Conductivity values are then extracted from only ﬁtting the
CPE of the blocking electrodes. In the representative
impedance response of Li6PS4.5Se0.5Br, two contributions can
be found. For the semicircle at high frequencies, an apex
frequency of 1.5 × 106 Hz and a capacitance of 7.7 × 10−12 F·
cm−2 is obtained. Meanwhile, the second semicircle at
midfrequencies exhibits a capacitance of 2 5 × 10−9 F·cm−2
The magnitudes of the capacitances37 and the ideality of the
CPE of the ﬁtted semicircles (α = 0.99)38 correspond well with
the bulk process at high frequencies and a grain boundary
contribution in the midfrequency range. As both processes
cannot be resolved at elevated temperatures, the overall ionic
conductivities are based on the total conductivity of the
samples. However, at 233 K, the grain boundary resistance
corresponds to ∼10% of the overall resistance and is clearly
decreasing at room temperature. This suggests that the total
conductivities can be related to the bulk transport with an
upper limit to the uncertainty of ∼10%

--------------------------------------------------
Room-temperature ionic conductivities for Li6PS5−xSexBr as
a function of x are shown in Figure 6a. The ionic conductivities
span from 2.7 to 3.9 mS·cm−1 over the entire compositional
range, showing the fast-ionic conducting nature of the
argyrodites. In addition to the room temperature values, the
activation barriers EA for lithium migration and the Arrhenius
prefactors σ0 are shown in Figure 6b. Despite the incorporation
of the larger, more polarizable Se anions and the concurrent
unit cell expansion, no signiﬁcant decrease in the activation
barrier is observed. While there is no obvious trend in the
conductivity with the respect to the selenium content, similar
to Na3PS4−xSex,31,39,40 the value of 3.9 mS·cm−1 is the highest
reported value for Li+ conductivity in the argyrodite structure
so far.
4. DISCUSSION
Upon moving from Li6PS5Br to Li6PS4SeBr, a variety of
structural changes have been observed that can be used to
explain the starting hypothesis that (1) increasing anion
polarizability and (2) replacing the free S2−site with Se2−will
aﬀect the structure and ionic transport.
4.1. Inﬂuence of Lattice Softness. The inﬂuence of more
polarizable anions on the ionic transport in solids has recently
been experimentally corroborated in Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I)20
for Li+ transport and Na3PS4−xSex for Na+ transport.31,41 Using
the Debye frequencies obtained from speed of sound
measurements, it was found that, with increasing polarizability
of the anions the lattice softness increases With this increasing
softness of the lattice vibrations, the activation energy EA and
Arrhenius prefactor σ0 decrease, showing that the paradigm of
“the softer, the better” is not entirely correct.42 On the one
hand, the softer vibrational properties of the anion sublattice
lead to lower activation barriers, as the oscillatory frequency ν0
(or attempt frequency) of the moving ion is related to the
activation barrier via:43

(3)
This attempt frequency is typically approximated by the Debye
frequency,26 and explains the decreasing activation barriers
with increasing softness of lattice vibrations.42 On the other
hand, as the entropy of migration44 ΔSm and the attempt
frequency of the moving ion43 are decreasing with softer lattice
vibrations, it directly aﬀects the Arrhenius prefactor σ0

Here, for a small vibration approximation, the entropy of
migration is governed by the normal frequencies v1, ..., vN for
vibrations about the initial and saddle point

As shown in Figure 7a, in this work, a similar trend of
decreasing prefactor and decreasing activation energy with the
softening of the lattice (decreasing Debye frequency) can be
seen, further corroborating the inﬂuence of a softer lattice on
ionic transport. The empirical relationship between decreasing
EA and σ0, the so-called Meyer−Neldel rule,45 can be found in
Figure 7b. With decreasing activation barrier, the prefactor
decreases and does not lead to a tremendous improvement of
the overall ionic conductivity. Indeed, the slope of the Meyer−
Neldel plot has been linked to the phononic properties of the
lattice,42,46−48 as the overall lattice vibrational properties
govern the prefactor and activation barrier and similar slopes
are obtained relative to Li6PS5X.20 Notably, the overall changes
in the lattice vibrational frequencies are smaller when
compared to Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) or Na3PS4−xSex, and
Li6PS4SeBr exhibits a stiﬀer lattice than Li6PS4SBr. This likely
stems from the fact that the diﬀerence in the electronegativity
of the halides is larger, as well as the fact that much lower
fractions of S are exchanged for Se (a maximum of 25%) with
respect to the whole chalcogenide content. Overall, these data
conﬁrm the recently found work on the inﬂuence of lattice
dynamics on ionic transport; a softer lattice not only aﬀects the
enthalpy of migration,49 and with it the activation barrier, but
also aﬀects the prefactor of ionic motion due to the changing
entropy of migration and attempt frequencies.20,31,41,42,46 This
shows that further eﬀorts are necessary to break the prefactor
dilemma42 arising from the Meyer−Neldel law and that
theoretical considerations need to take the lattice dynamics
into account.
4.2. Site Disorder and Diﬀusion Pathways. In addition
to the concurrent decrease of the prefactor and activation
barrier due to the lattice dynamics, the static structural changes
play a large role on the ionic conductivity and potential energy
landscape.42 Figure 4 shows that, with increasing unit cell
volume due to the larger radius of Se2−, the diﬀusion pathway,
as expressed by the LiCh3Br tetrahedra volumes and LiS3
planar areas, increases. While the LiS3 planar area only
corresponds to the local doublet jump from 48h−48h, the
widening of the diﬀusion pathways with the LiCh3Br
tetrahedra would usually suggest a better ionic conductivity
and lower activation barriers for ionic motion.50 This is a
common theme in most ionic conductors, such as the garnets
or NASICONs,36,51,52 in which broader pathways are usually
beneﬁcial. However, it has recently been shown that, while in
general this assumption is true, local structural changes may
interfere.30 Indeed, especially in the argyrodite structure, the
local site disorder between X−and Ch2−has been shown to
inﬂuence the transport,20,22,26 in which less disorder leads to an
increasing activation barrier. In the here studied solid solution
Li6PS5−xSexBr (0 ≤x ≤1), the Br−/Ch2−site disorder
decreases (as evidenced by the neutron pair distribution
function analysis) and vanishes entirely for x = 1, which should
lead to an increase in the activation barrier.20 It may indeed be
the case that site disorder is important when there is a large
mismatch between the anion radii such as I−and S2−, as seen
in the Li6PS5I.20 At low site disorder, one may expect a
narrower bottleneck for the intercage jump
whereas this
mismatch is small, as seen here with Br−/Ch2−(Ch = S, Se).
These data suggest that competing eﬀects are at play in
Li6PS5−xSexBr (0 ≤x ≤1), in which the broadening of the
diﬀusion pathways should lead to enhanced transport, while
the decreasing site disorder should be detrimental. The
combined eﬀect leads to only minor changes in the observed
transport, showing that, in more complex materials, competing
eﬀects can be at play. Depending on the predominant diﬀusion
pathway, these locally competing eﬀects can even be
dominating, as seen in less isotropic materials such as
Li10Ge1−xSnxP2S12,30 or cancel each other out in materials
with isotropic diﬀusion pathways such as the Li+ argyrodites.
5. CONCLUSION
In this work, Se2−substitution within Li6PS5−xSexBr (0 ≤x ≤
1) was performed to study the eﬀect of the changing lattice
polarizability, as well as the inﬂuence of the Br−/Ch2−
exchange on the free chalcogen Ch2−site, on the structure
and lithium transport properties. Using a combination of X-ray
diﬀraction, neutron pair distribution function analysis, and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the inﬂuence of the
structural changes brought on by an increasing Se content on
the associated lithium transport behavior was elucidated. With
increasing Se2−substitution, an increase in the lattice
parameters and the occupancy of the 16e Wyckoﬀposition
by Se2−, corresponding to the formation of PS3Se3−polyhedra,
was observed. In addition, a drastic decrease in the Br−/Ch2−
site disorder was also observed. These changes in the structure
lead to changes in the local Li+ sublattice, inducing a
rearrangement of Li+ from the 24g to the 48h site and a
widening of the diﬀusion pathways.
Impedance spectroscopy and speed of sound measurements
showed that, with a change in the lattice softness, both the
Arrhenius prefactor and activation energy are aﬀected. In
addition, while the broadening of the Li+ diﬀusion pathways
should be more beneﬁcial for the ionic transport, the vanishing
site disorder with Se substitution seems to counteract the eﬀect
of the Li+ sublattice. While the highest reported value for Li+
conductivity in the argyrodite structure so far of 3.9 mS·cm was
found, this work highlights the importance of competing
structural considerations in the optimization of ionic
conductivity in lithium thiophosphate superionic conductors
and further emphasizes that a better understanding of dynamic
lattice eﬀects on ionic transport is still required.

BSTRACT: Lithium-ion conducting argyrodites have recently attracted significant
erest as solid electrolytes for solid-state battery applications. In order to enhance the
lity of materials in this class, a deeper understanding of the fundamental structure−
operty relationships is still required. Using Rietveld refinements of X-ray diffraction
ta and pair distribution function analysis of neutron diffraction data, coupled with
ctrochemical impedance spectroscopy and speed of sound measurements, the
ucture and transport properties within Li6PS5−xSexBr (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) have been
onitored with increasing Se content. While it has been previously suggested that the
corporation of larger, more polarizable anions within the argyrodite lattice should lead
enhancements in the ionic conductivity, the Li6PS5−xSexBr transport behavior was
und to be largely unaffected by the incorporation of Se [2][−] due to significant structural
odifications to the anion sublattice. This work affirms the notion that, when
timizing the ionic conductivity of solid ion conductors, local structural influences
nnot be ignored and the idea of “the softer the lattice, the better” does not always
ld true.

NTRODUCTION


the past few years, solid ion conductors have garnered
iderable attention due to their potential as separators in
-state lithium-ion-battery applications. [1][−][3] The employt of solid electrolytes possessing high ionic conductivities,
by replacing the ubiquitous liquid electrolytes used in
entional lithium-ion batteries, enables the realization of
and more reliable batteries with higher energy and power
ities. Among the myriad of solid electrolytes that are
ntly available, the class of lithium thiophosphates have
found to exhibit some of the most exceptional ionic
uctivities, e.g., Li10MP2S12, [4][−][11] Li7P3S11, [12][−][14] thiophose glass ceramics, [15][−][19] and the Li6PS5X argyrodites, [20][−][24]

ng others. [25] Nevertheless, a better understanding of the
iples governing ionic transport in solid ion conductors is
required in order to access the next generation of
rolyte materials.

sites for the lithium ions (Wyckoff 48h and 24g) form cage-like
polyhedra around the free chalcogenide anions, enabling three
different jump processes to occur during ionic transport:
lithium ion jumps between neighboring lithium positions
(48h−24g−48h; doublet jump), intracage jumps (48h−48h),
and intercage jumps (48h−48h), as shown in Figure 1b.
In this work, the substitution of S [2][−] by Se [2][−] was performed
within Li6PS5−xSexBr (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) in order to assess the
influence of incorporating a larger, more polarizable anion
upon the free sulfur site 4d on the resultant structure and
lithium transport behavior, while maintaining the existing
diffusion pathways. The goal of this study is twofold: (1) The
incorporation of larger and less electronegative atoms has been
predicted to enhance the ionic conductivity. [24] In theory,
incorporating larger, more polarizable anions in the argyrodite
lattice should broaden the lithium diffusion pathways and
weaken interactions between Li [+] and the anion framework due
to changing lattice dynamics, leading to an increase in the
associated ionic conductivity. (2) In addition, by substituting
only the free chalcogen site, it may be possible to alter the
known site disorder between Br [−] and Ch [2][−] .
Using a combination of X-ray diffraction, neutron pair
distribution function, impedance spectroscopy, and ultrasonic
sound response measurements, this work shows that, in the
Li6PS5−xSexBr system, the potential for structural changes that
alter the interactions between the mobile Li [+] atoms and the

egy. While the larger anion broadens the lithium diffusion
ways, a local structural reordering and loss of site disorder
ters the beneficial, wider diffusion pathways. In addition,
hanging lattice dynamics affect the activation energy and

tural considerations in the development of ionic

XPERIMENTAL METHODS

nthesis. All preparations and sample treatments were carried
nder an Ar atmosphere. Lithium sulfide (Li2S, Sigma-Aldrich,
%), lithium bromide (LiBr, ChemPur, 99.995%), P (ChemPur,
9%), S (Acros Organics, 99.999%), and Se (Alfa Aesar,
9%) were mixed in the appropriate stoichiometric ratios using
ate mortar. The precursor mixtures were pressed into pellets and
d in quartz ampules (10 mm inner diameter and 10−12 cm in

̅

h) under vacuum. All ampules were carbon-coated and preheated
0 °C under dynamic vacuum for 3 h to avoid all traces of water in
eaction atmosphere. The reaction mixtures were treated at 550
r 2 weeks to ensure reaction completeness and the phase purity
e products.
ray Powder Diffraction. Powder X-ray diffraction measures were carried out using an Empyrean diffractometer
Nalytical, Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation (λ1 = 1.54051 Å,
1.54433 Å) in Bragg−Brentano θ−θ geometry using a PIXcel3D
detector with 255 measuring channels. Samples were pulverized
placed on (911)-oriented silicon zero diffraction holders and
d with Kapton foil. Measurements have been performed within a
nge of 10−90° with a step size of 0.026° and 180 s per step.
etveld Analysis. Rietveld refinements were carried out using
OPAS software package. [27] The peak profile shape was described
pseudo-Voigt function using the modified Thomson−Cox−
ngs setting. Fit indicators: Rwp, Rexp, and GoF were used to assess
uality of the refined structural models. The following parameters
initially refined: (1) scale factor, (2) background coefficients, (3)
shape, (4) lattice constants, (5) fractional atomic coordinates of
ulfur atoms on the Wyckoff 16e site, (6) isotropic atomic
acement parameters, and (7) sample displacement. The Se
nt was fixed to the nominal value for all refinements, given the
g agreement with the experimental stoichiometry determined by
[y dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Figure S1 and Table S1). In](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b02443/suppl_file/ic8b02443_si_001.pdf)
on, as X-rays are not able to resolve the lithium occupancies,
values were fixed on the basis of previously obtained structural
extracted from neutron diffraction data of Li6PS5Br. [20] The
ic occupancies of S and Se on the Wyckoff 16e position were
d in order to quantify the exchange between S and Se on the



Wyckoff 4a and 16e positions. Finally, atomic occupancies of Br and S
were refined in order to quantify the anion site disorder in
Li6PS5−xSexBr (x = 0, 0.1, and 0.2) between Br (Wyckoff 4a) and S
(Wyckoff 4d). Beyond this range of Se incorporation, the similar
electron densities of Se and Br inhibited the deconvolution of the Br [−]

/S [2][−] exchange on the Wyckoff 4d and 4a sites, respectively.
Neutron Pair Distribution Function Analysis. Quartz capillaries with an outer diameter of 0.9 mm were filled in an argon
glovebox and sealed using epoxy. Neutron scattering data suitable for
pair distribution function analysis were collected at room temperature
using the TOF NOMAD instrument at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory beamline (Oak Ridge, TN).
The crystallographic data, obtained from the refinements of the
Bragg data, were used as starting values for the analysis of the PDF
data of Li6PS5−xSexBr (x = 0, 0.5, 1.0). The pair distribution function
G(r) was employed for a more accurate structural analysis, and the
Oak Ridge software was used to extract G(r) from the raw diffraction
data. A maximum scattering vector (Qmax) of 22 Å [−][1] was employed in
the Fourier transform. Structural refinements were carried out using
the PDFgui software. [28] The local crystal structure of the
Li6PS5−xSexBr crystallites was refined with the F4̅3m space group.
The fit of this structural model to the experimental PDF data was
performed in the 1.8−30 Å interatomic distance range. The following
parameters were refined: (1) scale factor, (2) lattice constants, (3)
local correlated motion factor, (4) fractional atomic coordinates of the
lithium atoms and the sulfur atoms on the Wyckoff 16e site, and (5)
atomic isotropic displacement parameters. The Se content was fixed
to the nominal content for all refinements, given the strong agreement
with the experimental stoichiometry determined by energy dispersive
[X-ray spectroscopy (Figure S1 and Table S1). The atomic](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b02443/suppl_file/ic8b02443_si_001.pdf)
occupancies of S and Se on the Wyckoff 16e position were refined
in order to quantify the exchange between S and Se on the Wyckoff
4a and 16e positions. Finally, atomic occupancies of Br, S, and Se
were refined in order to quantify the anion site disorder between Br
(Wyckoff 4a) and S/Se (Wyckoff 4d). The Rw indicator was
employed to assess the quality of the refined structural models.
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. Electrical conductivities were measured by AC impedance spectroscopy, using
isostatically pressed pellets (325 MPa, 3.0 mm thickness, 9.5 mm
diameter, geometric density of all samples &gt;83%) that have been
rapidly annealed at 550 °C for 10 min in an evacuated quartz ampule
and were afterward gold coated with thin gold (200 nm) electrodes.
Electrochemical impedance analysis was conducted in the temperature range 233−333 K using an SP300 impedance analyzer
(Biologic) at frequencies from 7 MHz to 100 mHz with an amplitude
of 10 mV.
Ultrasonic Speed of Sound Measurements. Pulse-echo speed
of sound measurements were performed on consolidated discs using
an Epoch 600 (Olympus) with 5 MHz transducers for longitudinal
and transverse speeds of sound. The samples were coated with a thin

ant and the sample. All measurements were performed under a

d data results stems from the uncertainty in the thickness and the
ity. As the measurement uncertainty for the thickness of the

xpected to add significantly to the measurement uncertainty. In
on, no damping of the signal is expected due to the high
allinity and high speed of sound in Au. This measurement

thereby obeying Vegard’s law and confirming the successful
synthesis of solid solutions within the Li6PS5−xSexBr (0 ≤ x ≤
1) series. The observed lattice expansion is induced by the
larger ionic radius of Se [2][−] (1.98 Å) relative to S [2][−] (1.84 Å). [35]

Within the argyrodite structure, the chalcogenide anions either
coordinate with P [5+] to form PCh43− tetrahedra or occupy the
free Ch [2][−] sites (Wyckoff 16e or 4d, respectively). Interestingly,
with increasing x, beyond the increase in the occupancy of the
Wyckoff 4d site (i.e., the free Ch [2][−] site), an increase in the
occupancy of the Wyckoff 16e site by Se can also be seen
(Figure 3b). This increasing occupancy of Se on the tetrahedra
drives the observed expansion of the PCh4 tetrahedra (Figure
3c). At the composition of Li6PS4SeBr, approximately 50% of
the selenium occupy the free Ch [2][−] site, with the other half
replacing sulfur on the PS43− tetrahedra. The increasing
occupancy of the 16e site by Se was further corroborated by
[Raman spectroscopy (Figure S2). Here, as the occupancy of](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b02443/suppl_file/ic8b02443_si_001.pdf)
the 16e site by Se increases, the formation of PS3Se [3][−]
tetrahedra breaks the tetrahedral symmetry of the PCh4 units
and augments the intensity of the symmetric stretching mode
at 367 cm [−][1] with increasing x.
As described above, site disorder between Br [−] and the
chalcogenide anions is also known to occur, [20][,][22][,][26] in which the
free chalcogenide anions exchange with Br [−] to additionally
occupy the Wyckoff 4a sites. Figure 3d shows the obtained
disorder between Br [−] and Ch [2][−], and the percentage of disorder
shown represents the total fraction of Br [−] on the Ch [2][−] site.
Given the similar X-ray scattering form factors of Br [−] and Se [2][−],
only exchange between Br [−] and S [2][−] was refined from the X-ray
scattering data for x = 0, 0.1, and 0.2. Beyond this
compositional range, the refinement of the site disorder was
unstable due to the increasing Se content and the difficulty in
distinguishing Br [−] and Se [2][−] . Fortunately, Br and Se are
distinguishable by neutron diffraction, and thus, both types of

̅ exchange (i.e., S [2][−] and Se [2][−] ) with Br [−] could be adequately

refined for x = 0, 0.5, and 1.0 using the neutron pair
distribution function data. There are no unexpected variations
in the local structure, as seen in the G(r), and a good
agreement can be found between the refined X-ray and
neutron diffraction data, where the obtained disorder for
Li6PS5Br was approximately 23% and rapidly decreases with
increasing Se content. While the refined site disorder in
Li6PS5Br confirms the values found by Kraft et al. [20] and
Minafra et al., [21] the decreasing disorder remains puzzling.
Theoretically predicted [26] and experimentally confirmed, [20] a

ructural Characterization. The Li [+] superionic argyrs Li6PS5−xSexBr (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) have been synthesized in
r to study the influence of (1) increasing the anion
izability and (2) replacing the free S [2][−] site with Se [2][−] on
the structure and the transport properties. In the case of
the replacement of sulfur with the larger and more
izable selenium is expected to affect the lattice dynamics
expand the unit cell volume, both of which should in turn
t the ionic transport. [24][,][31][,][34] In the case of (2), site disorder
een the free S [2][−] (Wyckoff 4d) and Br [−] (Wyckoff 4a) has
shown to affect the activation barrier for ionic motion, [20]

controls the bottleneck of the intercage jumps, in which
e site disorder seems to be beneficial for the long-range
port. In addition, it was recently shown that the X [−] /S [2][−]
disorder decreases when the size mismatch between the
r and the halide anions increases. [20]

- take a closer look at the structural influences of Se
rporation on the resultant argyrodite structure, Rietveld
ements of powder X-ray diffraction patterns were
rmed. Additionally, due to the low X-ray form factor of
as well as the nearly identical electron densities of Br [−] and
and with it their scattering form factor for X-rays, selected
ples (x = 0, 0.5, 1.0) were also investigated using neutron
distribution function (PDF) analysis. Employment of a

mation concerning both the changing Li [+] substructure

r anion size mismatch between the halide X [−] and S [2][−]

to a decreasing site disorder in Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I). In
here presented case of replacing S [2][−] with Se [2][−], however,
pposite is true. With decreasing size mismatch (r(Se [2][−] ) =
Å, r(S [2][−] ) = 1.84 Å, and r(Br [−] ) = 1.96 Å), the site disorder
eases. [35] While the underlying reason for the opposite trend
e evolution of the site disorder remains unknown, it may
elated to the substitution of S [2][−] by Se [2][−] on the 16e
ion and, with it, the formation of local PS3Se [3][−] tetrahedra.
sidering Figure 4d, local changes in the tetrahedra may
gly affect the local ordering of the anions. Furthermore,
absence of site disorder coupled with the small size
match between S [2][−], Se [2][−], and Br [−] suggests that more subtle
ronic structure effects may also be influencing the site
der. Nevertheless, as site disorder is known to influence
onic transport, i.e., hindering the intercage jumps at low
s of disorder or in the absence of disorder, [20][,][26] an
ence on the Li [+] distribution and ionic transport in the
n studied solid solutions can be expected.
gure 4 shows the effect of Se substitution on the Li [+]

ttice in Li6PS5−xSexBr (x = 0, 0.5, 1.0), as obtained from
PDF analysis of the neutron diffraction data. With
asing Se content, the lithium occupancy on the 48h
koff site can be seen to increase, with a concurrent
ease in the occupancy of the 24g transition state (Figure

Considering the coordination of Li [+] (48h) around the free
site, forming clusters of lithium (Figure 1b), one may
ct that the reduced site disorder, and with it the higher
ge density of Ch [2][−] vs Br [−], leads to a higher occupancy of



Li [+] on the 48h site. The higher occupancy on the 48h site leads
to more Coulombic repulsion between these two sites, which
concurrently increases the doublet jump distance 48h−24g−
48h and decreases the intercage jump (see Figure 4b). While
the occupancies of the different positions change, there seems
to be no significant change in the Li positions to suggest
altered diffusion trajectories, in accordance with the work by
Kraft et al. [20] In addition to the Li [+] occupancies and jump
distances, the width of the diffusion pathway is important in
ionic conductors. [30][,][36] The Li ions on the Wyckoff 48h position
are coordinated by three Ch [2][−] and one Br [−], forming LiCh3Br
tetrahedra. Meanwhile, the Li ions on the Wyckoff 24g position
are coordinated by three sulfur, forming a trigonal planar LiS3
arrangement, and correspond to the transition state between
the doublet jumps. [20] Depictions of the polyhedra and planes
along the conduction pathway, in addition to the variation in
the polyhedral volumes and planar areas with changing
composition, are provided in Figure 4c and d. With increasing
Se content, the unit cell increases and the lithium diffusion
pathways also broaden.
Ionic Transport. Temperature-dependent electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy was performed on all samples to
monitor the changes in the ionic conductivity in Li6PS5−xSexBr
with respect to the Se content. For clarity, only representative

uency of 1.5 × 10 [6] Hz and a capacitance of 7.7 × 10 [−][12] F·
is obtained. Meanwhile, the second semicircle at
requencies exhibits a capacitance of 2.5 × 10 [−][9] F·cm [−][2] .



The magnitudes of the capacitances [37] and the ideality of the
CPE of the fitted semicircles (α = 0.99) [38] correspond well with
the bulk process at high frequencies and a grain boundary
contribution in the midfrequency range. As both processes
cannot be resolved at elevated temperatures, the overall ionic
conductivities are based on the total conductivity of the
samples. However, at 233 K, the grain boundary resistance
corresponds to ∼10% of the overall resistance and is clearly
decreasing at room temperature. This suggests that the total
conductivities can be related to the bulk transport with an
upper limit to the uncertainty of ∼10%.

DISCUSSION


n moving from Li6PS5Br to Li6PS4SeBr, a variety of
tural changes have been observed that can be used to
in the starting hypothesis that (1) increasing anion
izability and (2) replacing the free S [2][−] site with Se [2][−] will
t the structure and ionic transport.
1. Influence of Lattice Softness. The influence of more
izable anions on the ionic transport in solids has recently
experimentally corroborated in Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) [20]

i [+] transport and Na3PS4−xSex for Na [+] transport. [31][,][41] Using
Debye frequencies obtained from speed of sound
urements, it was found that, with increasing polarizability
e anions, the lattice softness increases. With this increasing



with a geometrical factor z, the carrier concentration of mobile
ions n, the jump distance a0, and the charge of the ions Ze.
Here, for a small vibration approximation, the entropy of
migration is governed by the normal frequencies v1, ..., vN for
vibrations about the initial and saddle point, I and S,

softness of the lattice vibrations, the activation energy EA and
Arrhenius prefactor σ0 decrease, showing that the paradigm of
“the softer, the better” is not entirely correct. [42] On the one
hand, the softer vibrational properties of the anion sublattice
lead to lower activation barriers, as the oscillatory frequency ν0
(or attempt frequency) of the moving ion is related to the
activation barrier via: [43]



_ν_ 0 =





Li (3)



This attempt frequency is typically approximated by the Debye
frequency, [26] and explains the decreasing activation barriers
with increasing softness of lattice vibrations. [42] On the other
hand, as the entropy of migration [44] ΔSm and the attempt
frequency of the moving ion [43] are decreasing with softer lattice
vibrations, it directly affects the Arrhenius prefactor σ044

disorder effect becomes smaller when the anion-radius
mismatch is small, as seen here with Br [−] /Ch [2][−] (Ch = S, Se).
These data suggest that competing effects are at play in
Li6PS5−xSexBr (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), in which the broadening of the
diffusion pathways should lead to enhanced transport, while
the decreasing site disorder should be detrimental. The
combined effect leads to only minor changes in the observed
transport, showing that, in more complex materials, competing
effects can be at play. Depending on the predominant diffusion
pathway, these locally competing effects can even be
dominating, as seen in less isotropic materials such as
Li10Ge1−xSnxP2S12, [30] or cancel each other out in materials
with isotropic diffusion pathways such as the Li [+] argyrodites.


5. CONCLUSION
In this work, Se [2][−] substitution within Li6PS5−xSexBr (0 ≤ x ≤
1) was performed to study the effect of the changing lattice
polarizability, as well as the influence of the Br [−] /Ch [2][−]
exchange on the free chalcogen Ch [2][−] site, on the structure
and lithium transport properties. Using a combination of X-ray
diffraction, neutron pair distribution function analysis, and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the influence of the
structural changes brought on by an increasing Se content on
the associated lithium transport behavior was elucidated. With
increasing Se [2][−] substitution, an increase in the lattice
parameters and the occupancy of the 16e Wyckoff position
by Se [2][−], corresponding to the formation of PS3Se [3][−] polyhedra,
was observed. In addition, a drastic decrease in the Br [−] /Ch [2][−]
site disorder was also observed. These changes in the structure
lead to changes in the local Li [+] sublattice, inducing a
rearrangement of Li [+] from the 24g to the 48h site and a
widening of the diffusion pathways.
Impedance spectroscopy and speed of sound measurements
showed that, with a change in the lattice softness, both the
Arrhenius prefactor and activation energy are affected. In
addition, while the broadening of the Li [+] diffusion pathways
should be more beneficial for the ionic transport, the vanishing
site disorder with Se substitution seems to counteract the effect
of the Li [+] sublattice. While the highest reported value for Li [+]
conductivity in the argyrodite structure so far of 3.9 mS·cm was
found, this work highlights the importance of competing
structural considerations in the optimization of ionic
conductivity in lithium thiophosphate superionic conductors
and further emphasizes that a better understanding of dynamic
lattice effects on ionic transport is still required.

hown in Figure 7a, in this work, a similar trend of
easing prefactor and decreasing activation energy with the
ning of the lattice (decreasing Debye frequency) can be
further corroborating the influence of a softer lattice on
transport. The empirical relationship between decreasing
nd σ0, the so-called Meyer−Neldel rule, [45] can be found in

re 7b. With decreasing activation barrier, the prefactor
eases and does not lead to a tremendous improvement of
verall ionic conductivity. Indeed, the slope of the Meyer−
el plot has been linked to the phononic properties of the
e, [42][,][46][−][48] as the overall lattice vibrational properties
rn the prefactor and activation barrier and similar slopes
btained relative to Li6PS5X. [20] Notably, the overall changes
he lattice vibrational frequencies are smaller when
pared to Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) or Na3PS4−xSex, and
S4SeBr exhibits a stiffer lattice than Li6PS4SBr. This likely
s from the fact that the difference in the electronegativity
he halides is larger, as well as the fact that much lower
ons of S are exchanged for Se (a maximum of 25%) with
ect to the whole chalcogenide content. Overall, these data
rm the recently found work on the influence of lattice
mics on ionic transport; a softer lattice not only affects the
alpy of migration, [49] and with it the activation barrier, but
affects the prefactor of ionic motion due to the changing
opy of migration and attempt frequencies. [20][,][31][,][41][,][42][,][46] This
ws that further efforts are necessary to break the prefactor
mma [42] arising from the Meyer−Neldel law and that
retical considerations need to take the lattice dynamics
account.
2. Site Disorder and Diffusion Pathways. In addition
he concurrent decrease of the prefactor and activation
er due to the lattice dynamics, the static structural changes
a large role on the ionic conductivity and potential energy
cape. [42] Figure 4 shows that, with increasing unit cell
me due to the larger radius of Se [2][−], the diffusion pathway,
xpressed by the LiCh3Br tetrahedra volumes and LiS3
ar areas, increases. While the LiS3 planar area only
sponds to the local doublet jump from 48h−48h, the
ning of the diffusion pathways with the LiCh3Br
hedra would usually suggest a better ionic conductivity
lower activation barriers for ionic motion. [50] This is a
mon theme in most ionic conductors, such as the garnets
ASICONs, [36][,][51][,][52] in which broader pathways are usually
ficial. However, it has recently been shown that, while in
ral this assumption is true, local structural changes may
fere. [30] Indeed, especially in the argyrodite structure, the
site disorder between X [−] and Ch [2][−] has been shown to
ence the transport, [20][,][22][,][26] in which less disorder leads to an
asing activation barrier. In the here studied solid solution
S5−xSexBr (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), the Br [−] /Ch [2][−] site disorder
eases (as evidenced by the neutron pair distribution
ion analysis) and vanishes entirely for x = 1, which should
to an increase in the activation barrier. [20] It may indeed be
case that site disorder is important when there is a large
match between the anion radii such as I [−] and S [2][−], as seen
he Li6PS5I. [20] At low site disorder, one may expect a
ower bottleneck for the intercage jump, whereas this

ABSTRACT: Solid electrolytes with compositions of (100 −x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·
xLiBH4 (mol %, 0 ≤x ≤100) were mechanochemically prepared from the 75Li2S·25P2S5
(mol %) glass and LiBH4 crystal. The samples with x ≥43 have crystalline phases and
those with x ≤33 formed a glassy phase. The crystalline phase was identiﬁed as argyrodite
Li6PS5(BH4). The x = 50 sample formed a crystalline phase and demonstrated a high
lithium-ion conductivity of 1.8 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C with an activation energy of 16 kJ·
mol−1. The argyrodite-type crystal with a BH4
−anion that occupies the halide site is a
novel and promising solid electrolyte.
1. INTRODUCTION
All-solid-state lithium-ion batteries have attracted signiﬁcant
attention as next-generation batteries.1 The performance of the
all-solid-state batteries strongly depends on the conductivities
of the solid electrolytes.2 Recently, sulﬁde-based solid electro-
lytes have become more widespread because they possess high
conductivities (&gt;10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C)2−8 and good
mechanical properties for the formation of eﬀective interfaces
between solids.9,10 Adding lithium halides to glass electrolytes is
well-known to be eﬀective in improving conductivity. For
example, LiI in addition to sulﬁde-based glasses resulted in a
high conductivity of 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C.3,11,12 Argyrodite
Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, and I) also displayed high conductivities of
over 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C.13−16
Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) has been reported to exhibit
high lithium-ion conductivity and high stability to reduction at
high temperatures.17,18 LiBH4 is also attractive as an additive
salt in the solid electrolyte. Previous investigations19−21 have
revealed that the addition of LiBH4 to sulﬁde-based glassy solid
electrolytes by a mechanochemical process increases their
conductivities.20 The glasses were fabricated with compositions
ranging from x = 0 to 33 in (100 −x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·
xLiBH4 (mol %). It was discovered that crystals precipitated in
samples with x ≥43.19,20 A similar crystalline phase was also
observed in the LiBH4−P2S5 system.21
In this study, we mechanochemically prepared solid electro-
lytes with crystalline phases with a composition of (100 −
x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4. We determined that the pre-
pared crystal had an argyrodite phase and that the BH4
−anion
occupied the halide site of the argyrodite structure. The solid
electrolytes with the argyrodite-type phase exhibited a high
lithium-ion conductivity of 1.8 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C.
2. METHODS
Solid electrolytes with compositions of (100 −x)(0.75Li2S·
0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 (mol %, 43 ≤x ≤100) were prepared via a
mechanochemical process. In addition, (100 −x)(0.75Li2S·
0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 (mol %, x = 0 and 33) glasses were prepared
by the same process for comparison. Li2S (Idemitsu Kosan,
99.9%), P2S5 (Aldrich, 99%), and LiBH4 (Aldrich, 90%) were
used as starting materials. First, a stoichiometrically calculated
mixture of Li2S and P2S was mechanically milled in a 225 mL
ZrO2 pot with 2500 ZrO2 balls (4 mm in diameter) using a
planetary ball mill (Fritsch, Pulverisette 5) at 213 rpm for 45 h.
The resulting 75Li2S·25P2S5 glass was then mixed with a
calculated amount of LiBH4 crystals. Mechanical milling of this
mixture was performed in a 45 mL ZrO2 pot with 500 ZrO2
balls (4 mm in diameter) using a planetary ball mill (Fritsch,
Pulverisette 7) at 510 rpm for 15 h to form the (100 −
x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 solid electrolytes. All processes
were performed under a dry Ar atmosphere. The compositions
of the (100 −x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 samples are given
in Table 1. The ratio of BH4
−and PS4
3−was varied by integral
ratios.

X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) measurements with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.1542 nm) were performed using a diﬀractometer
(Rigaku, Ultima IV). An air-sealing holder was used to prevent
exposure of the samples to air. Rietveld reﬁnements were
performed using RIETAN-FP.22 The XRD data were collected
in the 2θ range between 10° and 80° at a scan rate of 0.1°·
min−1 and a step size of 0.02°. The structure was reﬁned
starting from the published XRD data by Rayavarapu et al.15
Diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on the
obtained samples sealed in an Al pan in a glovebox using a
thermal analyzer (Seiko Instruments Inc., DSC6200) at a
scanning rate of 10 °C min−1. Raman spectra were obtained
using a Raman spectrometer (HORIBA, LabRAM HR-800)
with a 325 nm He−Cd laser. To measure electrical
conductivities, the samples were ﬁrst placed under 360 MPa
pressure at room temperature to form pellets 10 mm in
diameter and 1−1.5 mm in thickness. ac impedance measure-
ments were performed using an impedance analyzer (Solartron,
1260) in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 8 MHz. The all-solid-
state cells were constructed in the same way as previously
reported elsewhere except that newly developed solid electro-
lytes were used.9
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the mechanochemically
prepared (100 −x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 samples. The
XRD patterns for x = 0 and 33 display characteristic halo
x ≤33 have a glassy state.20 For the samples with 43 ≤x ≤82,
unknown diﬀraction peaks, which were not attributed to the
starting materials of Li2S, P2S5, or LiBH4, were observed in the
XRD patterns. In the XRD pattern of the x = 82 sample, the
peaks attributed to LiBH4
23 were also observed, suggesting that
unreacted LiBH4 was present in a small quantity in the x = 82
sample.
The DSC curves of the (100 −x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·
xLiBH4 samples and the LiBH4 crystal are shown in Figure 2.
Gas generations were detected in Li2S−P2S5−LiI samples under
220 °C. For example, the weight loss due to the gas generation
was detected at 180 °C in the x = 50 sample by
thermogravimetric analysis conducted before the DSC
measurements. Thus, the DSC measurements were conducted
below the gas generation temperature. The gas generation
would be caused by thermal decomposition of the samples.
This suggests that this series of materials can be prepared only
by the low-temperature process. An endothermic peak at 113
°C in the LiBH4 curve can be attributable to a phase transition
from orthorhombic to hexagonal,24 which is observed at 113
°C. A similar endothermic peak is not observed for the (100 −
x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 samples except for the x = 82
sample, which partially includes the LiBH4 crystal. The DSC
curves for the x = 43, 50, and 54 samples exhibit broad
exothermic peaks at approximately 60−160 °C. The x = 0
sample has an exothermic peak at 213 °C, which has been
reported to arise from the crystallization of the glass.25 Thus, it
is considered that the broad exothermic proﬁles observed in the
x = 43, 50, and 54 samples are attributable to the crystallization
and/or increase in the crystallinity.
Figure 3 shows the Raman spectra of the (100 −
x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 samples and the LiBH4 crystal
between 200 and 3000 cm−1. The band at 420 cm−1 can be
attributed to the PS4
3−ions26 and is observed for samples
containing LiBH4. Samples containing LiBH4 also display a
broad band at approximately 2330 cm−1. This band can be
attributed to BH4
−ion vibrations. Vibration of the internal
BH4
−ions results in strong bands at 2275 and 2300 cm−1 for
the orthorhombic low-temperature phase and a broad band at
approximately 2300 cm−1 for the hexagonal high-temperature
phase.27 The bands observed in the spectra of the samples with
x ≤54 are similar to those observed in the high-temperature
phase. The band observed in the spectrum of the samples with
x = 82 is similar to that observed in the low-temperature
phase.27 The rotation of the BH4
−ions probably accelerates in
the high-temperature phase 28,29 where there is delocalization of

−ions. The BH4
−and Li+ ions
have weakened electrostatic interactions in the high-temper-
ature LiBH4 phase and the x ≤54 samples prepared in this
study.
The temperature dependence of the conductivities of the
50(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·50LiBH4 solid electrolyte (x = 50) and
75Li2S·25P2S5 glass (x = 0) is shown in Figure 4. The LiBH4
crystal data reported by Matsuo et al.17 are also shown for
comparison. In the temperature range from 20 to 70 °C, the
conductivities of the samples with x = 50 obey the Arrhenius
law and the conduction activation energy is determined to be
16 kJ mol−1. Although higher conductivities are obtained above
70 °C, accurate values are diﬃcult to measure because of the
extremely low resistance. The crystalline sample with x = 50
exhibits a higher conductivity (1.8 × 10−3 S cm−1) at 25 °C
than those of the 75Li2S·25P2S5 glass samples (2.7 × 10−4 S
cm−1) and the LiBH4 crystal high-temperature phase (1.0 ×
10−3 S cm−1 at 115°C17).
The inﬂuence of composition on the conductivity at room
temperature and activation energies for the (100 −x)(0.75Li2S·
0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 solid electrolytes is shown in Figure 5. The
experimental results of the glassy electrolytes with x = 0, 11,
and 3320 are also shown In the glass-forming region the
conductivity of the glasses increases and the activation energies
decrease with increasing LiBH4 content. The x = 50 crystalline
sample displays higher conductivity and lower activation energy
than those of the other compositions, suggesting that the
crystalline phase exhibits high lithium-ion conductivity. The
conductivity dramatically decreased in the x = 54 and x = 82
samples. The conductivity of the x = 82 sample was less than
10−6 S cm−1 at 25 °C. The reason of the decrease of the
conductivity has not been clariﬁed yet. One possibility is that
the highly resistive amorphous materials as LiBH4 were formed
at grain boundary of the highly conducting argyrodite
crystallites in the sample. The possibility of decreasing the
conductivities of crystalline phase with argyrodite phase was
also not denied at the present stage.
To characterize the crystal structure, samples with higher
crystallinity were prepared by heat treatment at 130 °C. Figure
6a shows the XRD patterns of the as-obtained and heat-treated
samples with an x = 50 composition. The intensities of the
diﬀraction peaks observed in the spectra of the as-obtained
sample increase with the heat treatment, indicating that the
exothermic peaks observed in Figure 2 can be attributed to
crystallization. The DSC results indicate that the x &gt; 33

samples are primarily composed of crystal and glass
components. The pattern of the newly formed crystal phase
is similar to that of the argyrodite-type crystal Li6PS5X (X = Cl,
Br, and I),14,15 suggesting that the obtained crystalline phase is
argyrodite-type. The ionic radii of Cl−(0.168 nm) and Br−
(0.195 nm) ions are similar to that of BH4
−ions (0.205 nm).30
Thus, we presume that the Li7−xPS6−x(BH4)x crystal precip-
itates, where BH4
−ions occupy the sites of Cl−or Br−ions in
the Li7−xPS6−xXx crystal. The structural model of the Li6PS5Cl
crystal reported by Rayavarapue et al.15 was used as a starting
point for the Rietveld reﬁnement.
Figure 6b shows the Rietveld reﬁnement pattern of the
heated x = 50 sample. The reﬁned structural parameters for
Li6PS (BH ) obtained from the Rietveld reﬁnements are
summarized in Table 2. Peak indexing of the XRD data
suggests that the new phase exhibits argyrodite structure in the
space group F4̅3m with a lattice parameter of 1.001(8) nm. The
BH4
−and S2−ions are disordered over the 4a site (0 0 0) (67%
BH4, 33% S) and 4d site (3/4 3/4 3/4) (33% BH4, 67% S). It
was previously reported that disorder in the S2−/X−(X = Cl,
Br, and I) distribution promotes lithium-ion mobility in
argyrodite-type crystals.15 The large I−ions cannot be
exchanged for S2−ions, and the resulting Li6PS5I is more
ordered and exhibits only moderate conductivity. The disorder
in the S2−/BH4
−distribution indicates that the Li6PS5(BH4)
crystal exhibits high lithium-ion conductivity. The increase in
the lattice parameter should also aﬀect the conductivity of the

reﬁnements were performed using the XRD data of the low
crystallinity sample. The Rietveld reﬁnements for the neutron
diﬀraction data of high crystallinity samples are necessary to
determine more accurate atomic coordinates for hydrogen and
lithium.
The conductivity of the heat-treated x = 50 sample was 1.9 ×
10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C, which is almost similar to that of as-
obtained samples. It is clear that the Li6PS5(BH4) phase is more
Li-rich compared with the (100 −x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·
xLiBH4 (x = 50) solid electrolytes. This suggests that the glass
matrix of the x = 50 sample has a lower Li+ ion concentration
than its nominal composition. However, the x = 50 solid
electrolytes that included the Li6PS5(BH4) phase and glass
matrix exhibited a high lithium-ion conductivity of more than
10−3 S cm−1. This suggests that both the glass matrix and
Li6PS5(BH4) phase display high lithium-ion conductivities. It is
deemed necessary to synthesize single Li6PS5(BH4) phase
crystals and examine their conductivity in the future.
All-solid-state cells using mechanochemically prepared Li2S−
P2S5−LiBH4 solid electrolytes with an argyrodite structure were
assembled in order to show their potentials for practical
applications. Figure 7 shows the charge−discharge curves of the
all-solid-state cells using (a) Li/TiS2, (b) In/LiCoO2, and (c)
In/LiFePO4 and the x = 50 sample. All of the all-solid-state
cells using Li2S−P2S5−LiBH4 was successfully charged and
discharged with the large capacities comparable to the
previously reported all-solid-state cells.2,31 There are few
reports of the all-solid-state cells with a LiFePO4 positive
electrode material. The all-solid-state cell using Li metal was
also charged and discharged. The Li2S−P2S5−LiBH4 solid
electrolytes have high potential for practical use.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In this study, (100 −x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 solid
electrolytes were prepared by a mechanochemical process.
Glassy samples were obtained in the composition range for x
(mol %) from 0 to 33, and samples with argyrodite crystalline
phase were obtained at x &gt; 33. The DSC curves for the samples
with LiBH4 did not exhibit the peak attributed to the phase
transition of LiBH4. The Raman spectra of the (100 −
x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 samples displayed bands attrib-
uted to both BH4
−and PS4
3−ions. In the glass-forming region,
the conductivity of the glass increased with increasing LiBH4
content. The x = 50 samples that included newly formed crystal
phases also exhibited a high conductivity of 1.8 × 10−3 S cm−1
at 25 °C and a low conduction activation energy of 16 kJ mol−1.
Through Rietveld reﬁnements of the x = 50 sample, the novel
crystal phase was identiﬁed as an argyrodite-type crystal,
Li6PS5(BH4). The disorder of the S2−/BH4
−distribution
indicates that the argyrodite-type crystal Li6PS5(BH4) exhibits
high lithium-ion conductivity.

BSTRACT: Solid electrolytes with compositions of (100 − x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·
iBH4 (mol %, 0 ≤ x ≤ 100) were mechanochemically prepared from the 75Li2S·25P2S5
mol %) glass and LiBH4 crystal. The samples with x ≥ 43 have crystalline phases and
ose with x ≤ 33 formed a glassy phase. The crystalline phase was identified as argyrodite

6 [PS] 5 [(BH] 4 [). The][ x][ = 50 sample formed a crystalline phase and demonstrated a high]
hium-ion conductivity of 1.8 × 10 [−][3] S cm [−][1] at 25 °C with an activation energy of 16 kJ·
ol [−][1] . The argyrodite-type crystal with a BH4− anion that occupies the halide site is a
vel and promising solid electrolyte.



NTRODUCTION

olid-state lithium-ion batteries have attracted significant
tion as next-generation batteries. [1] The performance of the
lid-state batteries strongly depends on the conductivities
e solid electrolytes. [2] Recently, sulfide-based solid electrohave become more widespread because they possess high
uctivities (&gt;10 [−][3] S cm [−][1] at 25 °C) [2][−][8] and good
hanical properties for the formation of effective interfaces
een solids. [9][,][10] Adding lithium halides to glass electrolytes is
known to be effective in improving conductivity. For
ple, LiI in addition to sulfide-based glasses resulted in a
conductivity of 10 [−][3] S cm [−][1] at 25 °C. [3][,][11][,][12] Argyrodite
S5X (X = Cl, Br, and I) also displayed high conductivities of
10 [−][3] S cm [−][1] at 25 °C. [13][−][16]

hium borohydride (LiBH4) has been reported to exhibit
lithium-ion conductivity and high stability to reduction at
temperatures. [17][,][18] LiBH4 is also attractive as an additive
n the solid electrolyte. Previous investigations [19][−][21] have
aled that the addition of LiBH4 to sulfide-based glassy solid
rolytes by a mechanochemical process increases their
uctivities. [20] The glasses were fabricated with compositions
ng from x = 0 to 33 in (100 − x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·
H4 (mol %). It was discovered that crystals precipitated in
les with x ≥ 43. [19][,][20] A similar crystalline phase was also
rved in the LiBH4−P2S5 system. [21]

this study, we mechanochemically prepared solid electrowith crystalline phases with a composition of (100 −
75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4. We determined that the pred crystal had an argyrodite phase and that the BH4− anion
pied the halide site of the argyrodite structure. The solid



electrolytes with the argyrodite-type phase exhibited a high
lithium-ion conductivity of 1.8 × 10 [−][3] S cm [−][1] at 25 °C.


2. METHODS

Solid electrolytes with compositions of (100 − x)(0.75Li2S·
0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 (mol %, 43 ≤ x ≤ 100) were prepared via a
mechanochemical process. In addition, (100 − x)(0.75Li2S·
0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 (mol %, x = 0 and 33) glasses were prepared
by the same process for comparison. Li2S (Idemitsu Kosan,
99.9%), P2S5 (Aldrich, 99%), and LiBH4 (Aldrich, 90%) were
used as starting materials. First, a stoichiometrically calculated
mixture of Li2S and P2S was mechanically milled in a 225 mL
ZrO2 pot with 2500 ZrO2 balls (4 mm in diameter) using a
planetary ball mill (Fritsch, Pulverisette 5) at 213 rpm for 45 h.
The resulting 75Li2S·25P2S5 glass was then mixed with a
calculated amount of LiBH4 crystals. Mechanical milling of this
mixture was performed in a 45 mL ZrO2 pot with 500 ZrO2
balls (4 mm in diameter) using a planetary ball mill (Fritsch,
Pulverisette 7) at 510 rpm for 15 h to form the (100 −
x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 solid electrolytes. All processes
were performed under a dry Ar atmosphere. The compositions
of the (100 − x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 samples are given
in Table 1. The ratio of BH4− and PS43− was varied by integral
ratios.

uctivities, the samples were first placed under 360 MPa
ure at room temperature to form pellets 10 mm in

%, 0 ≤ x ≤ 100) solid electrolytes and LiBH4 crystal.


Gas generations were detected in Li2S−P2S5−LiI samples under
220 °C. For example, the weight loss due to the gas generation
was detected at 180 °C in the x = 50 sample by
thermogravimetric analysis conducted before the DSC
measurements. Thus, the DSC measurements were conducted
below the gas generation temperature. The gas generation
would be caused by thermal decomposition of the samples.
This suggests that this series of materials can be prepared only
by the low-temperature process. An endothermic peak at 113
°C in the LiBH4 curve can be attributable to a phase transition
from orthorhombic to hexagonal, [24] which is observed at 113
°C. A similar endothermic peak is not observed for the (100 −
x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 samples except for the x = 82
sample, which partially includes the LiBH4 crystal. The DSC
curves for the x = 43, 50, and 54 samples exhibit broad
exothermic peaks at approximately 60−160 °C. The x = 0
sample has an exothermic peak at 213 °C, which has been
reported to arise from the crystallization of the glass. [25] Thus, it
is considered that the broad exothermic profiles observed in the
x = 43, 50, and 54 samples are attributable to the crystallization
and/or increase in the crystallinity.

Figure 3 shows the Raman spectra of the (100 −
x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 samples and the LiBH4 crystal
between 200 and 3000 cm [−][1] . The band at 420 cm [−][1] can be
attributed to the PS43− ions26 and is observed for samples
containing LiBH4. Samples containing LiBH4 also display a
broad band at approximately 2330 cm [−][1] . This band can be
attributed to BH4− ion vibrations. Vibration of the internal
BH4− ions results in strong bands at 2275 and 2300 cm−1 for
the orthorhombic low-temperature phase and a broad band at
approximately 2300 cm [−][1] for the hexagonal high-temperature
phase. [27] The bands observed in the spectra of the samples with
x ≤ 54 are similar to those observed in the high-temperature
phase. The band observed in the spectrum of the samples with
x = 82 is similar to that observed in the low-temperature
phase. [27] The rotation of the BH4− ions probably accelerates in

[́] the high-temperature phase, [28][,][29] where there is delocalization of

patterns; it has been previously reported that the samples with
x ≤ 33 have a glassy state. [20] For the samples with 43 ≤ x ≤ 82,
unknown diffraction peaks, which were not attributed to the
starting materials of Li2S, P2S5, or LiBH4, were observed in the
XRD patterns. In the XRD pattern of the x = 82 sample, the
peaks attributed to LiBH423 were also observed, suggesting that

unreacted LiBH4 was present in a small quantity in the x = 82
sample.
The DSC curves of the (100 − x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·
xLiBH4 samples and the LiBH4 crystal are shown in Figure 2.

conductivity of the glasses increases and the activation energies
decrease with increasing LiBH4 content. The x = 50 crystalline
sample displays higher conductivity and lower activation energy
than those of the other compositions, suggesting that the
crystalline phase exhibits high lithium-ion conductivity. The
conductivity dramatically decreased in the x = 54 and x = 82
samples. The conductivity of the x = 82 sample was less than
10 [−][6] S cm [−][1] at 25 °C. The reason of the decrease of the
conductivity has not been clarified yet. One possibility is that
the highly resistive amorphous materials as LiBH4 were formed
at grain boundary of the highly conducting argyrodite
crystallites in the sample. The possibility of decreasing the
conductivities of crystalline phase with argyrodite phase was
also not denied at the present stage.
To characterize the crystal structure, samples with higher
crystallinity were prepared by heat treatment at 130 °C. Figure
6a shows the XRD patterns of the as-obtained and heat-treated
samples with an x = 50 composition. The intensities of the
diffraction peaks observed in the spectra of the as-obtained
sample increase with the heat treatment, indicating that the
exothermic peaks observed in Figure 2 can be attributed to
crystallization. The DSC results indicate that the x &gt; 33

BH4− and S2− ions are disordered over the 4a site (0 0 0) (67%

was previously reported that disorder in the S [2][−] /X [−] (X = Cl,
Br, and I) distribution promotes lithium-ion mobility in
argyrodite-type crystals. [15] The large I [−] ions cannot be
exchanged for S [2][−] ions, and the resulting Li6PS5I is more
ordered and exhibits only moderate conductivity. The disorder
in the S [2][−] /BH4− distribution indicates that the Li6PS5(BH4)
crystal exhibits high lithium-ion conductivity. The increase in
the lattice parameter should also affect the conductivity of the
crystal. The argyrodite-type Li6PS5(BH4) phase refined here is a

he conductivity of the heat-treated x = 50 sample was 1.9 ×
S cm [−][1] at 25 °C, which is almost similar to that of asned samples. It is clear that the Li6PS5(BH4) phase is more
ch compared with the (100 − x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·
H4 (x = 50) solid electrolytes. This suggests that the glass
ix of the x = 50 sample has a lower Li [+] ion concentration
its nominal composition. However, the x = 50 solid
rolytes that included the Li6PS5(BH4) phase and glass
ix exhibited a high lithium-ion conductivity of more than
S cm [−][1] . This suggests that both the glass matrix and
S5(BH4) phase display high lithium-ion conductivities. It is
med necessary to synthesize single Li6PS5(BH4) phase
als and examine their conductivity in the future.

−LiBH4 solid electrolytes with an argyrodite structure were

cations. Figure 7 shows the charge−discharge curves of the
lid-state cells using (a) Li/TiS2, (b) In/LiCoO2, and (c)

harged with the large capacities comparable to the
ously reported all-solid-state cells. [2][,][31] There are few
rts of the all-solid-state cells with a LiFePO4 positive
rode material. The all-solid-state cell using Li metal was

S Supporting Information
ABSTRACT: Mechanochemical synthesis using CeCl3-MBH4 (M = Li, Na or K) mixtures are investigated and produced a new
compound, LiCe(BH4)3Cl, which crystallizes in a cubic space group I4̅3m, a = 11.7204(2) Å. The structure contains isolated
tetranuclear anionic clusters [Ce4Cl4(BH4)12]4−with a distorted cubane Ce4Cl4 core, charge-balanced by Li+ cations. Each Ce
atom coordinates three chloride ions and three borohydride groups via the η3−BH3 faces, thus completing the coordination
environment to an octahedron. Combination of synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diﬀraction (SR-PXD), powder neutron
diﬀraction and density functional theory (DFT) optimization show that Li cations are disordered, occupying 2/3 of the 12d
Wyckoﬀsite. DFT calculation indicates that LiCe(BH4)3Cl is stabilized by higher entropy rather than lower enthalpy, in accord
with the disorder in Li positions. The structural model also agrees well with the very high lithium ion conductivity measured for
LiCe(BH4)3Cl of 1 × 10−4 Scm−1 at T = 20 °C. In situ SR-PXD reveals that the decomposition products consist of LiCl, CeB6
and CeH2. The Sieverts measurements show that 4.7 wt % H2 is released during heating to 500 °C. After rehydrogenation at 400
°C and p(H2) = 100 bar for 24 h an amount of 1.8 wt % H2 is released in the second dehydrogenation. The 11B MAS NMR
spectra of the central and satellite transitions for LiCe(B(D/H)4)3Cl reveal highly asymmetric manifolds of spinning sidebands
from a single 11B site, reﬂecting dipolar couplings of the 11B nuclear spin with the paramagnetic electron spin of the Ce3+ ions.

■INTRODUCTION
The transition toward a sustainable, environmentally friendly
and carbon free energy system that can fulﬁll the increasing
energy demands is considered one of the greatest challenges in
the 21st century.1 In particular, a safe, compact, and eﬃcient
means of storage of renewable energy still remains to be
identiﬁed. Chemical storage of energy as hydrogen or electricity
in a battery is among the most promising approaches with a
potential to reach the required high energy contents.2−4 This
has prompted the present research project where a new lithium-
and cerium -based borohydride chloride is prepared and
characterized.
Hydrogen is abundant, easy to produce by electrolysis, and
has the potential to be stored eﬃciently in the solid state, e.g,.
as metal borohydrides, which currently receive increasing
interest. Unfortunately, many of the known borohydrides
exhibit poor thermodynamic and kinetic properties, which
hamper their utilization in technological applications.5−8
Therefore, signiﬁcant focus has been on synthesis and
characterization of novel bimetallic borohydrides because of
their somewhat tunable decomposition temperatures.9−12
Furthermore, recent studies of metal borohydrides reveal a
remarkable diversity in the structural topologies illustrated by a
new nanoporous magnesium borohydride γ-Mg(BH4)2 with
33% empty volume.13 The compounds LiZn2(BH4)5 and
NaZn2(BH4)5 are built from two identical interpenetrated
three-dimensional frameworks consisting of isolated complex
anions, [Zn2(BH4)5]−, whereas NaZn(BH4)3 consists of
isolated anions of [Zn(BH4)3]−counter balanced by
sodium.14,15 Isolated complex anions have also been observed
in other structures, such as [Sc(BH4)4]−in MSc(BH4)4 (M =
Li, Na or K) or [Zn(BH4)Cl2]−in the heteroleptic
borohydride, KZn(BH4)Cl2.16−20 Several of these mixed-
metal borohydrides exhibit improved thermodynamic and
kinetic properties, e.g. LiSc(BH4)4 and NaSc(BH4)4 are found
to decompose in the temperature ranges 140 to 260 °C and
167 to 267 °C, respectively.16−18 These are signiﬁcantly lower
temperatures as compared to the corresponding alkali
borohydrides, LiBH4 and NaBH4, which decompose at
approximately 380 and 400 °C, respectively.21
The complex borohydride ion may resemble the halide ions
in the solid state, which may facilitate anion substitution in
metal borohydrides. The halide stabilized lithium borohydride

which tend to stabilize the hexagonal polymorph to room
temperature.22−24 The hexagonal halide stabilized polymorphs
h-Li(BH4)1−xXx, were found to have very high lithium ion
conductivities in the range 1 × 10−5 to 1 × 10−4 Scm−1 at room
temperature, RT, which increase to about 1 × 10−2 S cm−1 at
150 °C.25 These materials are considered as possible electro-
lytes for solid-state lithium batteries.26
Structural, thermodynamic and kinetic properties as well as
thermal stability and decomposition reactions are of vital
importance for possible applications of reversible hydrogen
carriers and rechargeable lithium battery materials. In some
cases, metal borohydrides may release gaseous boranes, such as
diborane, which leads to decreasing storage capacity of the
hydrogen storage system.27 Therefore, formation of metal
borides during decomposition is an important indication of
possible reversibility, since boron is kept in the solid state.
Furthermore, formation of metal borides is preferred to
formation of elemental boron due to the high stability of the
latter. Therefore, detailed characterization of new lithium
containing metal borohydrides may open new routes for design
and preparation of materials with a potential utilization for
hydrogen storage or lithium batteries.
Here we report on the synthesis, characterization and
thermal decomposition of a new lithium borohydride material,
LiCe(BH4)3Cl by in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray
diﬀraction (SR-PXD), powder neutron diﬀraction (PND),
density functional theory (DFT) optimizations, solid-state
magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), thermal analysis and Sievert measurements.
■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Synthesis. The title compound was prepared from samples of
CeCl3−LiBH4 in the molar ratios 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4, denoted samples
s1−s3, s5 respectively (see Table 1). The samples were ball-milled
(BM) in repeated sequences of 2 min BM and 2 min pauses for 60
repetitions using a Fritsch Pulverisette 4 planetary mill under inert
conditions (argon atmosphere) in 80 mL of tungsten carbide steel
containers with tungsten carbide balls (o.d. Ten mm). The sample to
balls mass ratio was approximately 1:35. Speeds of the main disk and
of the planetary disks were 200 and 560 rpm, respectively.
A sample for neutron diﬀraction experiments was prepared from
CeCl3−Li11BD4 in molar ratio 1:3 (sample s4) using the same milling
conditions as described above. Furthermore, samples of CeCl3-MBH4
(MNa or K) in molar ratios 1:3 and 1:4 (samples s6−s9,
respectively) were prepared by ball milling The CeCl −KBH samples
for sample s1−s5. The CeCl3−NaBH4 samples (s6 and s7) were also
initially ball milled using these conditions, however, as no reaction
occurred, the samples were subsequently ball milled for additional 30
repetitions applying 2 min BM and 2 min pauses with speeds of the
main disk and the planetary disks of 250 and 625 rpm, respectively.
All preparation and manipulation of the samples were performed in
a glovebox with a circulation puriﬁer maintained under an argon
atmosphere with &lt;1 ppm of O2 and H2O. The chemicals used were
anhydrous cerium chloride, CeCl3 (Sigma-Aldrich 99.9%), lithium
borohydride, LiBH4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 95%), lithium borodeuteride,
Li11BD4 (KatChem, 95%), sodium borohydride (Sigma-Aldrich, 95%)
and potassium borohydride (Sigma-Aldrich, 95%). All chemicals were
used as received.
Laboratory Powder X-ray Diﬀraction. All samples were initially
investigated using laboratory powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXD) in order
to identify the reaction products and estimate the crystallinity of the
samples. PXD measurements were performed in Debye−Scherrer
transmission geometry using a Stoe diﬀractometer equipped with a
curved Ge(111) monochromator (Cu Kα1 radiation, λ = 1.54060 Å)
and a curved position sensitive detector. Data were collected at RT
from 4 to 127° 2θ with counting times of ∼960 s per step. Air-sensitive
samples were mounted in a glovebox in 0.5 mm glass capillaries sealed
with glue.
In situ Synchrotron Radiation Powder X-ray Diﬀraction. In
situ SR-PXD data was collected at the Swiss-Norwegian Beamlines
(SNBL) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in
Grenoble, France. A glass capillary (o.d. 0.5 mm) containing the
sample was heated from RT to 500 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min, while SR-
PXD data was collected. The temperature was controlled with a
Cyberstar hot air blower. The data were collected using a MAR345
image plate detector at a sample to detector distance of 250 mm, and a
selected X-ray wavelength of λ = 0.709637 Å. The capillary was
oscillated 30° during X-ray exposure of the sample for 30 s.
All obtained raw images were transformed to powder patterns using
the FIT2D program,28 which was also used for calibration of the X-ray
wavelength and the sample−detector distance using a SR-PXD
measurements of the standard NIST LaB6 and masking diﬀraction
spots from the single-crystal sapphire sample holder. Uncertainties of
the integrated intensities were calculated at each 2θ point by applying
Poisson statistics to the intensity data, considering the geometry of the
detector.29
Powder Neutron Diﬀraction. The powder neutron diﬀraction
(PND) experiment was conducted at the high-resolution powder
neutron diﬀractometer HRPT at the spallation neutron source SINQ
at Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland.30 The powder
sample of ball milled CeCl3−Li11BD4 (1:3, s4) was enclosed in a
vanadium can (8 mm diameter), and data was collected with a neutron
wavelength of λ = 1.494 Å in the high intensity mode using the
standard ILL-type Orange cryostat at −271, −248, −223, and 25 °C.
Structure Solution of LiCe(BH4)3Cl. SR-PXD data collected at
∼160 °C for CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:4, s4), containing the highest fraction of
the new compound, was used for indexing and structure solution.
Indexing of the diﬀraction peaks was performed using the program
Dicvol in a body centered cubic cell (a = 11.7204(2) Å).31 The
structure was solved in space group I4̅3m by global optimization in
direct space using the program FOX,32 using one Ce, one Li, and one
Cl atom, and a rigid tetrahedral BH4 group as optimized units and a
number of antibump restraints. The structure contains one cerium and
one chloride atom located on 8c Wyckoﬀsites, while boron is located
on the 24g Wyckoﬀsite. The crystallographic positions of Ce, B, and
Cl determined from PXD and PND, respectively, are similar. However,
SR-PXD data alone showed some ambiguity for the Li positions.
Therefore, the position was determined from the combination of SR-
PXD data, PND data and DFT optimization of the resulting models
(discussed in more detail below). The only Li position consistent with
all diﬀraction data and energy minimizations is the 12d Wyckoﬀsite.
The Li occupancy reﬁnes to ca. 2/3, corresponding to the expected 8
Li atoms per unit cell. A symmetry check in Platon33 did not suggest
higher metric or crystallographic symmetry

compound is ρ = 1.87 g cm−3.
The ﬁnal Rietveld reﬁnement was performed using the PND data
measured at −248 °C on CeCl3−Li11BD4 (1:3, s4) and subsequently
the SR-PXD data measured at ∼160 °C on CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:4, s3)
using the program Fullprof,34 see Figure 1a and 1b. The background
was described by linear interpolation between selected points. Due to
an artifact SR-PXD data region 18.7−19.5° 2θ was omitted in the
reﬁnement. The ﬁnal reﬁnement on the SR-PXD data resulted in the
following reﬁnement factors, RB = 2.52%, RF = 1.6%, Rp = 2.62%, Rwp =
3.32% (not corrected for background) and Rp = 5.1%, Rwp= 5.98%
(corrected for background) and χ2 = 3760 (this value is high due to
the very high counting statistics accumulated by the 2D detector). The
reﬁnement factors from the PND data are RB = 5.50%, RF = 2.90%, Rp
= 2.67%, Rwp = 3.55% (not corrected for background) and Rp = 9.43%,
Rwp = 10.4% (corrected for background) and χ2 = 3084. The unit-cell
parameter reﬁnes to a = 11.4993(4) Å using the PND data. The
strongest reﬂections has a less strong inﬂuence in the Rietveld
reﬁnements due to the used weighting scheme: 1/σ(I) = 1/(I)1/2
other peaks. There was no indication of any preferred orientation in
the cubic structure. The atomic coordinates for LiCe(BH4)3Cl as
found from the ﬁnal reﬁnement on SR-PXD and PND data are shown
in Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information.
First-Principles Calculations. Several candidate structures
derived from the PXD and PND data were examined by density
functional theory calculations. The calculations were performed within
the generalized-gradient approximation by Perdew, Burke, and
Ernzerhof35 as implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation
Package.36 Projector augmented wave (PAW) potential with a
planewave cutoﬀenergy of 600 eV is used.37 For each atomic species,
Li, Ce, B, H, and Cl, the PAW potentials Li_sv, Ce_3, B, H, and Cl are
used, respectively. Three valence electrons are included in the Li_sv
potential, and a 4f electron in Ce is frozen to core in the Ce_3
potential.
A primitive cell having four formula units of LiCe(BH4)3Cl is used.
Regular k-point meshes of 2 × 2 × 2 in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone
including is Γ point are sampled, which ensures energy convergence
within 0.2 meV/f.u. Structural optimization was performed until the
force on each atom became smaller than 0.005 eV/Å. During the
optimization the lattice parameter was ﬁxed to the experimental value
from the SR-PXD analysis. Partial occupation at the 12d or 24g
(discussed in detail below) sites is modeled in the DFT optimization
by removing the 3-fold axes along the ⟨111⟩directions, which reduces
the symmetry to the space group I4̅2m (see Figure S1a in the
Supporting Information for the 12d model). The ﬁnal atomic
coordinates from the DFT optimization in the I-43m space group
was derived by applying 3-fold rotation along ⟨111⟩to the 12d model
(discussed in detail below).
Solid-State 11B MAS NMR Spectroscopy. Solid-state 11B MAS
NMR spectra were obtained on Varian INOVA-400 (9.4 T) and
Varian Direct-Drive VNMRS-600 (14.1 T) spectrometers using home-
built X-{1H} CP/MAS NMR probes for 5 mm and 4 mm o.d. rotors,
respectively. The experiments used 11B rf ﬁeld strengths of γB1/2π =
52 kHz (9.4 T) and γB1/2π = 60 kHz (14.1 T), a 4 s relaxation delay,
and 1H decoupling during acquisition (γB2/2π ≈45 kHz at both
magnetic ﬁelds). The NMR experiments were performed at ambient
temperature using airtight, end-capped zirconia rotors packed with the
samples in a Ar-ﬁlled glovebox. The 11B isotropic chemical shifts are in
ppm relative to F3B·O(CH2CH3)2.
Conductivity Measurements. Electrochemical Impedance Spec-
troscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using a BioLogic
VMP3 potentiostat. Either steel disks (ion blocking) or lithium foils
(nonblocking) were used as electrodes. Impedance (a.c.) spectra were
recorded at RT between 1 MHz and 10 mHz, with a voltage
perturbation of 25 mV. From the Nyquist plots of the complex
impedance (imaginary part Zim as a function of the real part Zre), the
resistances of the samples were obtained from the diameter of the
semicircle and from the intercept on the Zre axis for LiBH4 (reference
sample) and LiCe(BH4)3Cl, respectively. The conductivity measure-
ments were performed on ﬁve pellets made from sample CeCl3−
LiBH4 (1:3, s5). The pellets with a diameter of 10 mm and with
thicknesses in the range 0.5 to 2.0 mm were prepared by using a
uniaxial press (900 MPa). Sintering of the pellets was performed at RT
due to possible decomposition of the materials at elevated temper-
atures. The pellets densities were ca. 2.42 g cm−3, which corresponds
to a compactness of 93%, calculated using the density of sample
CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:3, s5) derived from the Rietveld reﬁned
composition, ρ(s5) = 2.61 g cm−3.
Thermal Analysis and Sievert Measurements. The samples
CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:3, s2) and (1:4, s3) were studied by thermogravi-
metric analysis (TGA), diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and
Sieverts’ measurements. Simultaneous TGA and DSC were performed
using a Netzsch STA449C Jupiter instrument in the temperature range
RT to 500 °C (ΔT/Δt = 10 °C/min) using corundum crucibles with
lid as sample holder. The experiments were conducted in helium (4.6)
atmosphere.
The cyclic reversibility of hydrogen release and uptake was studied
by Sieverts’ measurements using a PCTPro 2000 apparatus 38,39 Three

RT to 500 °C (ΔT/Δt = 1 °C/min) and then keeping the temperature
constant at 500 °C for 3 h with a back pressure of p(H2) = 1 bar.
Hydrogen absorption measurements was performed before the second
and third desorption cycle at 400 °C and p(H2) = 100 bar for 24 h.
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Synthesis and Initial Phase Analysis. Lithium cerium
borohydride chloride, LiCe(BH4)3Cl was synthesized by a
mechano-chemistry, i.e. ball milling (BM) of samples CeCl3−
LiBH4 (1:3, s2) and (1:4, s3). The SR-PXD data, collected at
RT after BM, show diﬀraction peaks from LiCe(BH4)3Cl, LiCl,
and CeCl3, indicating that the reaction shown in (1) occurs.

The gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density for LiCe-
(BH4)3Cl is ρm = 5.37 wt % H2 and ρv = 99.8 kg H2/m3,
respectively. The reaction between CeCl3 and LiBH4 is a
complex reaction, which is believed to be a coupled metathesis
and addition reaction leading to the formation of LiCe-
(BH4)3Cl and LiCl. The optimal stoichiometry between
reactants according to reaction 1 is 1:3. However, the reaction
is not completed using the selected ball milling conditions, as
unreacted CeCl3 is identiﬁed by PXD.
Upon heating, the reaction between CeCl3 and LiBH4
continues from 100 to 160 °C, where the maximum amount
of LiCe(BH4)3Cl is observed by SR-PXD. The composition of
s3 at 160 °C found by Rietveld reﬁnement is LiCe(BH4)3Cl 62
wt % (32 mol %), LiCl 22 wt % (61 mol %), and CeCl3 16 wt
% (7 mol %). s4 used for the PND experiment and 11B MAS
NMR analysis was also analyzed with SR-PXD measured at RT,
and the overall sample composition was LiCe(11BD4)3Cl 66 wt
% (28 mol %), LiCl 29 wt % (70 mol %) and CeCl3 5 wt % (2
mol %), which indicates that reaction 1 has occurred to a higher
extent during BM for this sample. Crystalline lithium
borohydride is not observed in the synthesis products for any
of the samples by SR-PXD or PND. However, LiBH4 was
conﬁrmed to be present in an amorphous state by NMR
analysis (see below). Prolonged ball milling times or conditions
facilitating higher energy during ball milling are possibly needed
to complete reaction 1.40 The samples CeCl3−NaBH4 and
CeCl3−KBH4 were treated at similar mechano-chemical
conditions as compared to the CeCl3−LiBH4 samples but no
indications for chemical reaction were observed.
Crystal Structure of LiCe(BH4)3Cl. LiCe(BH4)3Cl crystal-
lizes in a cubic unit cell, a = 11.7204(2) Å, with space group
symmetry I4̅3m (see Figure 2). The positions of Ce, B and Cl
ions were readily determined from the SR-PXD data. The
structure contains isolated tetranuclear anionic clusters of
[Ce4Cl4(BH4)12]4−with a distorted cubane Ce4Cl4 core,41
charge-balanced by Li+ cations (see Figure 3). Rietveld
reﬁnement of the PND data measured at −248 °C reveal a
η3−BD3−Ce coordination mode. The angles ∠Cl−Ce−Cl and
∠B−Ce−B are 73.26(16)° and 99.2(6)°, respectively, and the
Ce−Cl and Ce−B distances are 2.961(6) and 2.74(2) Å,
respectively. From the initial SR-PXD structural analysis some
ambiguity existed concerning the position of the Li+ ions and
several structural models were investigated by Rietveld
reﬁnement of SR-PXD data and PND data and by DFT
optimization, revealing that Li+ ions are disordered, occupying
2/3 of the 12d Wyckoﬀsite. Li+ ions coordinate tetrahedrally
four BD −groups via the tetrahedral edge i e
η2−BD −Li
(Figure 3). Three B−D distances are determined to be
1.181(8) Å (D1), 1.22(1) Å (D2) and 1.231(7) Å (D3). The
closest D···D contact is 1.9302(82) Å (D1−D3).
As mentioned, a combined analysis of data from SR-PXD,
PND and DFT optimization was utilized to locate the Li+ ions.
Besides the structure of LiCe(BH4)3Cl described above with
Li+ positioned on the 12d Wyckoﬀsite two other Li+ positions
were considered but eventually rejected (see Table 2). One of
these two models corresponds to the only possible fully
ordered arrangement of Li+ ions on the sites 2a and 6b.42 The
2a site is situated in the center of the distorted cubane cage
Ce4Cl4, resulting in Ce−Li distance of only 2.8757(14) Å. For
comparison, in a similar mixed metal borohydride chloride
NaY(BH4)2Cl2 the shortest Na−Y distance is 4.95 Å.43 Indeed,
DFT calculations on a model with the 2a site ﬁlled by Li+ ions
shows larger discrepancy for the position of Ce atoms with
respect to the experimental data
Moreover

--------------------------------------------------
reﬁnement of the occupancy for the 2a site gives a negative
value of −0.8 using the SR-PXD data, questioning the
credibility of the model.
In the third structural model for LiCe(BH4)3Cl, one-third of
the 24g site (x = 0.12350, z = 0.57580) is occupied by Li+ ions.
However, DFT optimization showed large displacements of
lithium and in particular hydrogen atom positions yielding a
model inconsistent with neutron diﬀraction data. The Rietveld
reﬁnement using the SR-PXD data reveal unacceptably short
Li−H distances of ∼1.2 Å. Because of the lack of agreement
between the theoretical and experimental data the third model
was also rejected.
DFT optimization showed that the 12d model (see Figure
S1a in the Supporting Information) has the lowest energy and
that the 2a/6b and the 24g model energies are higher by 0.42
and 1.14 eV/f.u, respectively. Furthermore, the optimized
(center of the cage)−Ce distance for the 12d and 2a model are
2.905 and 3.114 Å, respectively. This diﬀerence makes a
noticeable change in the simulated X-ray diﬀraction patterns
since the heaviest atom Ce most strongly scatters X-rays and
the 12d model reproduces the experimental pattern more
closely (see the R-values in Table 2). DFT optimization reveals
that relaxation of the unit cell volume leads to a rather large
expansion of 11.1% while accompanying a small decrease in
energy by 0.051 eV/f.u. for the model containing the 2a site.
Contrary to that, the model with 12d site remains stable, with
only 0.1% variation of the cell parameter and the related total
energy changes of less than 1 meV/f.u. Another ordered variant
of Li+ conﬁguration in the 12d site was modeled using DFT
(see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), which has
higher energy by only 0.028 eV/f.u. and almost constant unit
cell volume within 0.6% of the experimental value. The
similarities in energy and volume between diﬀerent hypotheti-
cally ordered 12d sites strongly support this model.
The formation energy for LiCe(BH4)3Cl from LiCl and
Ce(BH4)3 has also been estimated using DFT calculations.
Since the crystal structure of Ce(BH4)3 is unknown, the low
temperature polymorph of Y(BH4)3 was adopted as a
hypothetical “Ce(BH4)3” structure. Both LiCl and Ce(BH4)3
were simulated with the same approximations as LiCe-
(BH4)3Cl. The DFT optimized lattice parameter for “Ce-
(BH4)3” is a = 11.482 Å, which is somewhat larger than that of
Y(BH4)3 (a = 10.852 Å) and rather close to that observed for
LiCe(BH4)3Cl (a = 11.720 Å, this study), reﬂecting the
relatively larger ionic radius of Ce and weaker binding as
compared to Y(BH4)3. This may partly explain why formation
of LiCe(BH4)3Cl is preferred to the formation of “Ce(BH4)3”
under the same experimental condition. The reaction energy
for (2) is estimated to be slightly endothermic

Temperature eﬀects are not taken into account and ΔE is the
DFT total energy diﬀerence. Since the bonding characters are
largely preserved between the reactants and the product, ΔH
(T = 298 K) would not be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from ΔE (T =
0 K). Therefore, the structure of LiCe(BH4)3Cl may be
stabilized by higher entropy rather than lower enthalpy, and
this result again favors the 12d model because disorder in Li
positions would certainly contribute to the entropy.
In this study, a bimetallic borohydride chloride LiCe-
(BH4)3Cl is discovered, in contrast to other rare earth metal
borohydrides produced mechano-chemically from similar
metalborohydride-metalchloride reaction mixtures, i.e. LiSc-
(BH4)4,15 Y(BH4)3,44−48 and Gd(BH4)3,.44,49 This dissimilarity
might be due to diﬀerences in ionic ratio (given in parentheses)
for the lanthanides as compared to lithium, i.e. Li+ (0.76 Å) ≈
Sc3+ (0.75 Å) &lt; Y3+ (0.90 Å) &lt; Gd3+ (0.94 Å) &lt; Ce3+ (1.02 Å).
Apparently, anionic structures are preferred for the smallest
ions, as in LiSc(BH4)4, and formation of monometallic
framework structures seems to be more favorable for the
slightly larger lanthanides, e.g., Y(BH4)3 and Gd(BH4)3. The
largest lanthanides appear to facilitate formation of more
complex framework structures, as for LiCe(BH4)3Cl, which

Solid-State 11B MAS NMR. The 11B MAS NMR spectra of
the central and satellite transitions for the deuterated sample
CeCl3−Li11BD4 (1:4, s4) recorded at 14.1 and 9.4 T (Figure 4)
reveal manifolds of spinning side bands (ssb) from a single 11B
site, in agreement with the present crystal-structure determi-
nation. The appearance of the ssb manifolds in the three
spectra is highly asymmetric and thereby deviates from the
symmetric ssb patterns reported earlier for the 11B central and
satellite transitions in borohydride compounds.19,47,50 Although
asymmetries in the ssb intensities from the central and satellite
transitions may arise from the combined eﬀect of the
11B
quadrupole coupling and chemical shift anisotropy interactions,
as demonstrated in 11B MAS NMR spectra of borates,51 the
asymmetry in the present spectra reﬂects strong 11B nuclear
spin −paramagnetic electron-spin dipolar interactions52,53
present along with the 11B quadrupole coupling. Thus, the 11B
nuclear spin couples to the surrounding free electrons of the
paramagnetic Ce3+ ions, in accordance with cerium present as
the Ce3+ ion in LiCe(BH4)3Cl, i.e., the Ce4+ ion would result in
a diamagnetic compound. In addition to the asymmetry of the
ssb manifolds, these couplings also result in a signiﬁcant line
broadening of the individual ssbs. The fact, that the individual
11B spins couple to the paramagnetic electron from several Ce3+
ions in diﬀerent distances to the
11B site and that these
couplings are additive,52 prevents a straightforward simulation
of the ssb manifolds by consideration of the mutual eﬀects from
the
11B quadrupole coupling and
11B nuclear spin −
paramagnetic electron-spin dipolar couplings. However, the
observation of these heteronuclear dipolar couplings strongly
suggests that the paramagnetic electron is localized in a Ce3+
bonding and that it is nonconducting. It is unlikely that the
well-deﬁned 11B MAS NMR spectra shown in Figure 4 could
have observed if the unpaired electrons were conducting. An
estimation of the 11B quadrupole coupling constant (C ) can

be achieved from the width of the ssb manifolds, which equals
CQ for a spin I = 3/2, assuming that the width is dominated by
the ﬁrst-order quadrupole interaction for the satellite
transitions.54 The
11B MAS NMR spectra in Figure 4 are
shown on identical widths in Hz, demonstrating that this is an
acceptable approximation, and resulting in the estimated
quadrupole coupling of CQ = 420 kHz. This value is of the
same magnitude as earlier reported 11B quadrupole couplings
for BH4
−(BD4
−) sites in borohydrides.19,47,50 Moreover,
apparent 11B isotropic chemical shifts of δiso = 26.8 ppm and
δiso = 26.1 ppm are determined54 from the spectra recorded at
14 1 and 9 4 T (Figure 4a and b) respectively assuming C
=
(ηQ = 0). Although these values are nearly identical, the
apparent chemical shift for LiCe(BD4)3Cl in s4 is signiﬁcantly
shifted to high frequency as compared to the 11B chemical shift
range observed for BD4
−sites in diamagnetic borohydrides
(e.g., roughly from −35 to −47 ppm). This high-frequency shift
may reﬂect that the 11B spin −paramagnetic electron-spin
interactions also contribute with a Knight shift of the
11B
resonance. 11B MAS NMR spectra have also been acquired for
the hydrogen samples, i.e. LiCe(BH4)3Cl in s1 −s3 (not
shown), which reveal the same centerband (δ = 26 ppm) and
ssb manifold as observed for the deuterated sample (Figure 4)
along with a centerband resonance at δiso = −41.2 ppm and a
few associated ssbs from LiBH4 in the samples. LiBD4 is also
observed in the s4 sample, as most clearly seen in the 9.4 T
spectrum recorded with a spinning speed of νR = 12.0 kHz
(Figure 4b). However, evaluation of the intensities for the two
compounds in this spectrum gives the intensity ratio
I(LiBD4):I(LiCe(BH4)3Cl) = 0.03, demonstrating that the
amount of LiBD4 is very small in the s4 sample.
Lithium Ion Conductivity. Conductivities are measured
for LiBH4 (Sigma-Aldrich, as received) and LiCe(BH4)3Cl
(sample CeCl3−LiBH4 1:3, s5) pellets between steel disks
acting as ionically blocking electrodes by impedance spectros-
copy, at T = 20 °C. The impedance spectra recorded for LiBH4
is shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S2. From the
diameter of the semicircle observed at high frequency, which is
related to the lithium ion mobility, a resistance of R = 8.35 ×
105 Ω is measured for a 0.56 mm pellet thickness. This leads to
a conductivity of 8.6 × 10−8 S cm−1 at 20 °C in good agreement
with the values reported for orthorhombic o-LiBH4.55 No
signature of the electrode interface or the grain boundaries are
observed on the impedance spectra.
For LiCe(BH4)3Cl, impedance spectra were recorded on
pellets of diﬀerent thicknesses and Figure 5 reveal that the
impedances are much lower than that of o-LiBH4, in all cases.
Only Warburg impedances related to the semi-inﬁnite diﬀusion
at the electrodes are observed and frequencies higher than 1
MHz are needed to fully plot the semicircles assigned to the
lithium ion mobility in the material. Nevertheless, the shape of
the impedance spectra is typical of a good conductor and the
conductivity can be calculated from the intercept with the real
axis (Zre value). Figure 6 reveals for LiCe(BH4)3Cl a linear
relationship between the resistance and the pellet thickness

asterisks indicate the isotropic peak. The inset in (b) illustrates the

--------------------------------------------------
The extrapolated resistance for a zero thickness is very low (Ro
= 42 Ω) highlighting the quality of our electrode-material
interface. The slope of the linear ﬁt is R = 1232 Ω mm−1 hence
for a 10 mm diameter pellet a conductivity of 1.03 × 10−4 S
cm−1 is determined. The conductivity of the LiCe(BH4)3Cl
sample CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:3, s5) is therefore about 3 orders of
magnitude higher than that of o-LiBH4 at RT and is similar to
that found for the hexagonal h-LiBH4−LiI solid solution.25,56,57
Note that the CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:3, s5) sample is not a single
phase: the sample composition determined by Rietveld
reﬁnement is LiCe(BH4)3Cl 49 wt % (6 mol %), LiCl 17 wt
% (84 mol %), and CeCl3 34 wt % (10 mol %). Nevertheless, as
the conductivities of solid-state LiCl and CeCl3 are very low at
RT, the measured ionic conductivity undoubtedly originates
from the LiCe(BH4)3Cl compound. The volume fraction of
LiCe(BH4)3Cl in the CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:3, s5) sample is actually
high (82%) and a percolation phenomenon occurs giving a high
ionic conductivity to the pellet. Needless to say that a single-
phase LiCe(BH4)3Cl pellet should lead to higher conductivity
values and that synthesis eﬀorts are currently in progress in our
laboratories.
To investigate more in detail the nature of the conduction,
we also carried impedance spectroscopy out on a pellet
sandwiched between lithium foils acting as ion nonblocking
electrodes. On Figure 7, the resistivity is given for both the
measurements made between steel disks and between lithium
foils. The resistivity is similar in the case of the metallic lithium
electrodes and the shape of the impedance curve resembles a
curve for a good conductor. From the intercept with the real
axis, a conductivity of 7 × 10−5 S cm−1 is obtained at 20 °C.
This suggests that the LiCe(BH4)3Cl sample CeCl3−LiBH4
(1:3, s5) is a good lithium ion conductor. The high lithium ion
conductivity in LiCe(BH4)3Cl may be attributed to empty Li
positions in the structure. According to the structural model for
LiCe(BH4)3Cl, only 2/3 of the Li positions (12d Wyckoﬀsite)
are occupied in a disordered manner. These ﬁrst conductivity
measurements suggest that LiCe(BH4)3Cl could be considered
as a future candidate for a solid electrolyte in the next-
generation lithium-ion batteries. Recently, extremely high Li ion
conductivity of 1.2 × 10−2 S cm−1 was reported for the novel
compound Li GeP S
58 7Li NMR experiments are in progress
to demonstrate the high Li+ mobility and to deﬁnitively
conclude that the ionic conductivity originates solely from Li+
cations.
Thermal Analysis and Sievert Measurements. Ther-
mogravimetric (TGA) and diﬀerential scanning calorimetric
(DSC) measurements for samples CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:3, s2) and
(1:4, s3) are shown in Supporting Information, Figure S3, and
Figure 8, respectively. Sample s3 show a mass loss of 0.7 wt %
in the temperature range 150 to 240 °C and a larger loss in the
range 240 to 290 °C of 3.0 wt %. Thus, the observed mass loss
for sample s3 is 3.7 wt % in the temperature range RT to 500
°C, which is less than the calculated hydrogen content of the
sample, 4.84 wt % H2. The observed and calculated mass losses
for sample s2 are 3.2 and 3.88 wt % H2, respectively.
Considering that the decomposed samples contain cerium
dihydride, CeH2, the calculated hydrogen contents of the
samples s2 and s3 are 3.23 and 4.23 wt % H2.
The DSC data for s3 (see Figure 8) show two small
endothermic peaks at 93 and 109 °C, which may correspond to
the onset temperature for the reaction between remaining
CeCl3 and LiBH4 in the sample (see reaction scheme 1) and to
the polymorphic phase transition from orthorhombic to
hexagonal LiBH4. An endothermic peak observed at 213 °C
may correspond to the melting of LiCe(BH ) Cl A smaller
Figure 6. Resistance measured for the CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:3, s5) sample
as a function of the pellet thickness (10 mm diameter). The
extrapolated resistance for a ‘zero thickness’ is low (Ro = 42 Ω)
showing the quality of the material-electrode interface. The slope of
the linear ﬁt is R = 1232 Ω mm−1, which corresponds to a high
conductivity of 1.03 × 10−4 S cm−1 measured at T = 20 °C.

the initial decomposition of LiCe(BH4)3Cl. Indeed, the
decomposition may consist of multiple reactions visible as
shoulders at 257 and 261 °C at the major DSC signal with peak
value at 266 °C. The endothermic events at 213 and 266 °C are
correlated with the mass loss observed in the TGA data.
Reversible hydrogen storage properties were investigated
using Sieverts measurements for sample s3 and s2 and the data
is shown in Figure 9 and the Supporting Information, Figure
S4, respectively. Desorption data for sample s3 is collected in
the Supporting Information, Table S3. Sample s3 releases 0.5
wt % H2 from RT to 220 °C and a major H2 release of 3.25 wt
% H2 is observed from 220 to 270 °C, which corresponds to the
observations by TGA and DSC. Additionally, 0.80 wt % H2 is
released during heating from 270 to 500 °C and 0.15 wt % H2
is released after heating the samples for 3 h at a constant
temperature of 500 °C. Hence, the total observed H2 release is
4.7 wt % H2 for sample s3. In a previous study of the CeCl3−
LiBH4 system gas analysis revealed a very small amount of
diboran during hydrogen desorption.59 In the present study, the
mass loss from the samples are all below the theoretical content
of hydrogen; for this reason, the release of diboran from the
samples is assumed to be at a minimum.
The Sieverts measurements for the second (d2) and third
(d3) desorption follow a diﬀerent trend since only 0.25 wt %
H2 is released in the temperature range RT to 270 °C. In
contrast, desorptions d2 and d3 release 1.25 and 1.15 wt % H2
from 270 to 500 °C and 0.5 and 0.4 wt % H2 during 3 h at a
constant temperature of 500 °C. Thus, the desorption d2 and
d3 does not show the expected hydrogen release in the
temperature range RT to 270 °C for the decomposition of
LiCe(BH4)3Cl revealing that the sample is not fully
rehydrogenated at the selected conditions for hydrogen
absorption. In total, the desorption d2 and d3 release 2.0 and
1.8 wt % H2, which is slightly higher than the calculated
hydrogen content assuming that CeH2 or CeH3 is formed
during absorption of sample s3 i e
0 60 or 0 91 wt % H
LiBH4, which may be rehydrogenated and the calculated
hydrogen release from a sample s3 containing CeH2 and 1
equiv. of LiBH4 is 2.12 wt % H2. In contrast, sample s2 release
3.75 wt % H2 in the ﬁrst cycle (d1) and 1.25 and 1.25 wt % H2
in the second and third cycles, which is comparable to the
calculated H2 release of 3.88 and 0.97 wt % H2 assuming that s2
contain LiCe(BH4)3Cl prior to d1 and CeH3 for the later
desorption cycles (see the Supporting Information, Figure S4).
The decomposition products for s3 after the third desorption
(d3) in the Sieverts measurements (Figure 9) was investigated
by Rietveld reﬁnement of SR-PXD data (Figure 10). Diﬀraction
from the decomposition products LiCl, CeH2, and CeB6 are
identiﬁed along with an unknown compound.
Decomposition Mechanism for LiCe(BH4)3Cl Observed
by In situ SR-PXD. The thermal decomposition of samples
CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:3, s3) and (1:4, s4) were studied by in situ
SR-PXD. Both samples display similar decomposition mecha-
nism, though the decomposition products from s2 appear more
crystalline and are discussed in the following (Figure 11). The
ﬁrst SR-PXD patterns in the series measured at RT show
diﬀraction peaks from LiCe(BH4)3Cl, CeCl3 and LiCl. The
diﬀraction peaks from CeCl3 decreases slowly at T &gt; 63 °C and
disappear at 315 °C. During heating from 100 to 160 °C the
amounts of LiCe(BH4)3Cl and LiCl increase, while that of
CeCl3 decreases because of the progress of reaction 1. The
Bragg diﬀraction peaks from LiCe(BH4)3Cl disappears at 240
°C, possibly because of melting and subsequent decomposition
and diﬀraction from an unknown compound appear at 240 °C.
Peaks from CeH2 emerge at 320 °C when CeCl3 disappears.
The unknown compound may be a ternary salt composed of
lithium, cerium and chloride and remains in the sample during
the rest of the heating. A ternary salt, NaYCl4, is also observed
during the decomposition of NaY(BH4)2Cl2.43 Structural
determination of the unknown compound has unfortunately
not been possible, but further studies are currently being
performed to elucidate the atomic composition. The reaction
scheme (3) describes the idealized overall decomposition
reaction for s2 omitting the unknown compound

■CONCLUSION
The novel compound LiCe(BH4)3Cl crystallizes in the cubic
crystal system with the space group I4̅3m and the structure
contains
isolated
tetranuclear
anionic
clusters
[Ce4Cl4(BH4)12]4−with a distorted cubane Ce4Cl4 core
charge-balanced by Li+ cations. The Li+ ions are disordered
and occupy 2/3 of the 12d Wyckoﬀsites. The structural model
was derived by the combined use of synchrotron radiation
powder X-ray diﬀraction (SR-PXD), powder neutron diﬀrac-
tion (PND), and density functional theory (DFT) and would
likely not have been obtained with any combination of only two
of the methods. DFT indicates that LiCe(BH4)3Cl is stabilized
by higher entropy rather than lower enthalpy, in accord with
the disorder at the Li positions. The structural model and DFT
calculations agree well with the very high lithium ion
conductivity measured for the LiCe(BH4)3Cl containing
sample, 1.03 × 10−4 S cm−1 at T = 20 °C. Conductivity
measurements carried out between lithium foils suggest that the
conductivity mainly originates from the high lithium ion
mobility, which is in favor of our model of disordered Li. Solid-
state
11B MAS NMR spectra of the central and satellite
transitions reveal that the
11B spin interacts with the
paramagnetic electron-spins (from the unpaired electron on
Ce3+), which also contribute with a Knight shift of the 11B
resonance. Very high lithium ion conductivity is in favor of our
structural model including disordered Li. The new compound
LiCe(BH4)3Cl also stores 5.33 wt % hydrogen, which is
released in the temperature range 220−260 °C. Rehydrogena-
tion at moderate conditions leads to a reversible storage
capacity of only ∼1 wt % H2.

BSTRACT: Mechanochemical synthesis using CeCl3-MBH4 (M = Li, Na or K) mixtures are investigated and produced a new
mpound, LiCe(BH4)3Cl, which crystallizes in a cubic space group I43̅ m, a = 11.7204(2) Å. The structure contains isolated
ranuclear anionic clusters [Ce4Cl4(BH4)12] [4][−] with a distorted cubane Ce4Cl4 core, charge-balanced by Li [+] cations. Each Ce
om coordinates three chloride ions and three borohydride groups via the η [3] −BH3 faces, thus completing the coordination
vironment to an octahedron. Combination of synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD), powder neutron
ffraction and density functional theory (DFT) optimization show that Li cations are disordered, occupying 2/3 of the 12d
yckoff site. DFT calculation indicates that LiCe(BH4)3Cl is stabilized by higher entropy rather than lower enthalpy, in accord
th the disorder in Li positions. The structural model also agrees well with the very high lithium ion conductivity measured for
Ce(BH4)3Cl of 1 × 10 [−][4] Scm [−][1] at T = 20 °C. In situ SR-PXD reveals that the decomposition products consist of LiCl, CeB6
d CeH2. The Sieverts measurements show that 4.7 wt % H2 is released during heating to 500 °C. After rehydrogenation at 400
and p(H2) = 100 bar for 24 h an amount of 1.8 wt % H2 is released in the second dehydrogenation. The [11] B MAS NMR
ectra of the central and satellite transitions for LiCe(B(D/H)4)3Cl reveal highly asymmetric manifolds of spinning sidebands
m a single [11] B site, reflecting dipolar couplings of the [11] B nuclear spin with the paramagnetic electron spin of the Ce [3+] ions.

transition toward a sustainable, environmentally friendly
carbon free energy system that can fulfill the increasing
gy demands is considered one of the greatest challenges in
21st century. [1] In particular, a safe, compact, and efficient
ns of storage of renewable energy still remains to be
ified. Chemical storage of energy as hydrogen or electricity
battery is among the most promising approaches with a
ntial to reach the required high energy contents. [2][−][4] This
rompted the present research project where a new lithiumcerium -based borohydride chloride is prepared and
acterized.
ydrogen is abundant, easy to produce by electrolysis, and
he potential to be stored efficiently in the solid state, e.g,.
metal borohydrides, which currently receive increasing
est. Unfortunately, many of the known borohydrides
bit poor thermodynamic and kinetic properties, which
per their utilization in technological applications. [5][−][8]

efore, significant focus has been on synthesis and
acterization of novel bimetallic borohydrides because of
somewhat tunable decomposition temperatures. [9][−][12]

hermore, recent studies of metal borohydrides reveal a
rkable diversity in the structural topologies illustrated by a

new nanoporous magnesium borohydride γ-Mg(BH4)2 with
33% empty volume. [13] The compounds LiZn2(BH4)5 and
NaZn2(BH4)5 are built from two identical interpenetrated
three-dimensional frameworks consisting of isolated complex
anions, [Zn2(BH4)5] [−], whereas NaZn(BH4)3 consists of
isolated anions of [Zn(BH4)3] [−] counter balanced by
sodium. [14,15] Isolated complex anions have also been observed
in other structures, such as [Sc(BH4)4] [−] in MSc(BH4)4 (M =
Li, Na or K) or [Zn(BH4)Cl2] [−] in the heteroleptic
borohydride, KZn(BH4)Cl2. [16][−][20] Several of these mixedmetal borohydrides exhibit improved thermodynamic and
kinetic properties, e.g. LiSc(BH4)4 and NaSc(BH4)4 are found
to decompose in the temperature ranges 140 to 260 °C and
167 to 267 °C, respectively. [16][−][18] These are significantly lower
temperatures as compared to the corresponding alkali
borohydrides, LiBH4 and NaBH4, which decompose at
approximately 380 and 400 °C, respectively. [21]

The complex borohydride ion may resemble the halide ions
in the solid state, which may facilitate anion substitution in
metal borohydrides. The halide stabilized lithium borohydride

uctivities in the range 1 × 10 [−][5] to 1 × 10 [−][4] Scm [−][1] at room
erature, RT, which increase to about 1 × 10 [−][2] S cm [−][1] at
°C. [25] These materials are considered as possible electrofor solid-state lithium batteries. [26]

ructural, thermodynamic and kinetic properties as well as
mal stability and decomposition reactions are of vital
rtance for possible applications of reversible hydrogen
ers and rechargeable lithium battery materials. In some
, metal borohydrides may release gaseous boranes, such as
rane, which leads to decreasing storage capacity of the
ogen storage system. [27] Therefore, formation of metal
des during decomposition is an important indication of
ble reversibility, since boron is kept in the solid state.
hermore, formation of metal borides is preferred to
ation of elemental boron due to the high stability of the
. Therefore, detailed characterization of new lithium
aining metal borohydrides may open new routes for design
preparation of materials with a potential utilization for
ogen storage or lithium batteries.

tions as described above. Furthermore, samples of CeCl3-MBH4
Na or K) in molar ratios 1:3 and 1:4 (samples s6−s9,
ctively) were prepared by ball milling. The CeCl3−KBH4 samples



(s8 and s9) were subjected to the same ball milling conditions as used
for sample s1−s5. The CeCl3−NaBH4 samples (s6 and s7) were also
initially ball milled using these conditions, however, as no reaction
occurred, the samples were subsequently ball milled for additional 30
repetitions applying 2 min BM and 2 min pauses with speeds of the
main disk and the planetary disks of 250 and 625 rpm, respectively.
All preparation and manipulation of the samples were performed in
a glovebox with a circulation purifier maintained under an argon
atmosphere with &lt;1 ppm of O2 and H2O. The chemicals used were
anhydrous cerium chloride, CeCl3 (Sigma-Aldrich 99.9%), lithium
borohydride, LiBH4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 95%), lithium borodeuteride,
Li [11] BD4 (KatChem, 95%), sodium borohydride (Sigma-Aldrich, 95%)
and potassium borohydride (Sigma-Aldrich, 95%). All chemicals were
used as received.
Laboratory Powder X-ray Diffraction. All samples were initially
investigated using laboratory powder X-ray diffraction (PXD) in order
to identify the reaction products and estimate the crystallinity of the
samples. PXD measurements were performed in Debye−Scherrer
transmission geometry using a Stoe diffractometer equipped with a
curved Ge(111) monochromator (Cu Kα1 radiation, λ = 1.54060 Å)
and a curved position sensitive detector. Data were collected at RT
from 4 to 127° 2θ with counting times of ∼960 s per step. Air-sensitive
samples were mounted in a glovebox in 0.5 mm glass capillaries sealed
with glue.
In situ Synchrotron Radiation Powder X-ray Diffraction. In
situ SR-PXD data was collected at the Swiss-Norwegian Beamlines
(SNBL) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in
Grenoble, France. A glass capillary (o.d. 0.5 mm) containing the
sample was heated from RT to 500 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min, while SRPXD data was collected. The temperature was controlled with a
Cyberstar hot air blower. The data were collected using a MAR345
image plate detector at a sample to detector distance of 250 mm, and a
selected X-ray wavelength of λ = 0.709637 Å. The capillary was
oscillated 30° during X-ray exposure of the sample for 30 s.
All obtained raw images were transformed to powder patterns using
the FIT2D program, [28] which was also used for calibration of the X-ray
wavelength and the sample−detector distance using a SR-PXD
measurements of the standard NIST LaB6 and masking diffraction
spots from the single-crystal sapphire sample holder. Uncertainties of
the integrated intensities were calculated at each 2θ point by applying
Poisson statistics to the intensity data, considering the geometry of the
detector. [29]

Powder Neutron Diffraction. The powder neutron diffraction
(PND) experiment was conducted at the high-resolution powder
neutron diffractometer HRPT at the spallation neutron source SINQ
at Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland. [30] The powder
sample of ball milled CeCl3−Li [11] BD4 (1:3, s4) was enclosed in a
vanadium can (8 mm diameter), and data was collected with a neutron
wavelength of λ = 1.494 Å in the high intensity mode using the
standard ILL-type Orange cryostat at −271, −248, −223, and 25 °C.
Structure Solution of LiCe(BH4)3Cl. SR-PXD data collected at
∼160 °C for CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:4, s4), containing the highest fraction of
the new compound, was used for indexing and structure solution.
Indexing of the diffraction peaks was performed using the program
Dicvol in a body centered cubic cell (a = 11.7204(2) Å). [31] The
structure was solved in space group I43̅ m by global optimization in
direct space using the program FOX, [32] using one Ce, one Li, and one
Cl atom, and a rigid tetrahedral BH4 group as optimized units and a
number of antibump restraints. The structure contains one cerium and
one chloride atom located on 8c Wyckoff sites, while boron is located
on the 24g Wyckoff site. The crystallographic positions of Ce, B, and
Cl determined from PXD and PND, respectively, are similar. However,
SR-PXD data alone showed some ambiguity for the Li positions.
Therefore, the position was determined from the combination of SRPXD data, PND data and DFT optimization of the resulting models
(discussed in more detail below). The only Li position consistent with
all diffraction data and energy minimizations is the 12d Wyckoff site.
The Li occupancy refines to ca. 2/3, corresponding to the expected 8
Li atoms per unit cell. A symmetry check in Platon [33] did not suggest
higher metric or crystallographic symmetry. According to the

gest reflections has a less strong influence in the Rietveld

However, the relative error is expected in average to be the same as for
other peaks. There was no indication of any preferred orientation in
the cubic structure. The atomic coordinates for LiCe(BH4)3Cl as
found from the final refinement on SR-PXD and PND data are shown
in Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information.
First-Principles Calculations. Several candidate structures
derived from the PXD and PND data were examined by density
functional theory calculations. The calculations were performed within
the generalized-gradient approximation by Perdew, Burke, and
Ernzerhof [35] as implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation
Package. [36] Projector augmented wave (PAW) potential with a
planewave cutoff energy of 600 eV is used. [37] For each atomic species,
Li, Ce, B, H, and Cl, the PAW potentials Li_sv, Ce_3, B, H, and Cl are
used, respectively. Three valence electrons are included in the Li_sv
potential, and a 4f electron in Ce is frozen to core in the Ce_3
potential.
A primitive cell having four formula units of LiCe(BH4)3Cl is used.
Regular k-point meshes of 2 × 2 × 2 in the first Brillouin zone
including is Γ point are sampled, which ensures energy convergence
within 0.2 meV/f.u. Structural optimization was performed until the
force on each atom became smaller than 0.005 eV/Å. During the
optimization the lattice parameter was fixed to the experimental value
from the SR-PXD analysis. Partial occupation at the 12d or 24g
(discussed in detail below) sites is modeled in the DFT optimization
by removing the 3-fold axes along the ⟨111⟩ directions, which reduces
the symmetry to the space group I42̅ m (see Figure S1a in the
Supporting Information for the 12d model). The final atomic
coordinates from the DFT optimization in the I-43m space group
was derived by applying 3-fold rotation along ⟨111⟩ to the 12d model
(discussed in detail below).
Solid-State [11] B MAS NMR Spectroscopy. Solid-state [11] B MAS
NMR spectra were obtained on Varian INOVA-400 (9.4 T) and
Varian Direct-Drive VNMRS-600 (14.1 T) spectrometers using homebuilt X-{ [1] H} CP/MAS NMR probes for 5 mm and 4 mm o.d. rotors,
respectively. The experiments used [11] B rf field strengths of γB1/2π =
52 kHz (9.4 T) and γB1/2π = 60 kHz (14.1 T), a 4 s relaxation delay,
and [1] H decoupling during acquisition (γB2/2π ≈ 45 kHz at both
magnetic fields). The NMR experiments were performed at ambient
temperature using airtight, end-capped zirconia rotors packed with the
samples in a Ar-filled glovebox. The [11] B isotropic chemical shifts are in
ppm relative to F3B·O(CH2CH3)2.
Conductivity Measurements. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using a BioLogic
VMP3 potentiostat. Either steel disks (ion blocking) or lithium foils
(nonblocking) were used as electrodes. Impedance (a.c.) spectra were
recorded at RT between 1 MHz and 10 mHz, with a voltage
perturbation of 25 mV. From the Nyquist plots of the complex
impedance (imaginary part Zim as a function of the real part Zre), the
resistances of the samples were obtained from the diameter of the
semicircle and from the intercept on the Zre axis for LiBH4 (reference
sample) and LiCe(BH4)3Cl, respectively. The conductivity measurements were performed on five pellets made from sample CeCl3−
LiBH4 (1:3, s5). The pellets with a diameter of 10 mm and with
thicknesses in the range 0.5 to 2.0 mm were prepared by using a
uniaxial press (900 MPa). Sintering of the pellets was performed at RT
due to possible decomposition of the materials at elevated temperatures. The pellets densities were ca. 2.42 g cm [−][3], which corresponds
to a compactness of 93%, calculated using the density of sample
CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:3, s5) derived from the Rietveld refined
composition, ρ(s5) = 2.61 g cm [−][3] .
Thermal Analysis and Sievert Measurements. The samples
CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:3, s2) and (1:4, s3) were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and
Sieverts’ measurements. Simultaneous TGA and DSC were performed
using a Netzsch STA449C Jupiter instrument in the temperature range
RT to 500 °C (ΔT/Δt = 10 °C/min) using corundum crucibles with
lid as sample holder. The experiments were conducted in helium (4.6)
atmosphere.
The cyclic reversibility of hydrogen release and uptake was studied
by Sieverts’ measurements using a PCTPro 2000 apparatus. [38,39] Three

ystal Structure of LiCe(BH4)3Cl. LiCe(BH4)3Cl crystalin a cubic unit cell, a = 11.7204(2) Å, with space group
metry I43̅ m (see Figure 2). The positions of Ce, B and Cl
were readily determined from the SR-PXD data. The
ture contains isolated tetranuclear anionic clusters of
Cl4(BH4)12] [4][−] with a distorted cubane Ce4Cl4 core, [41]

ge-balanced by Li [+] cations (see Figure 3). Rietveld
ement of the PND data measured at −248 °C reveal a
BD3−Ce coordination mode. The angles ∠Cl−Ce−Cl and
Ce−B are 73.26(16)° and 99.2(6)°, respectively, and the
Cl and Ce−B distances are 2.961(6) and 2.74(2) Å,
ectively. From the initial SR-PXD structural analysis some
guity existed concerning the position of the Li [+] ions and
ral structural models were investigated by Rietveld
ement of SR-PXD data and PND data and by DFT
mization, revealing that Li [+] ions are disordered, occupying
of the 12d Wyckoff site. Li [+] ions coordinate tetrahedrally
BD4− groups via the tetrahedral edge, i.e., η2−BD2−Li

closest D···D contact is 1.9302(82) Å (D1−D3).
As mentioned, a combined analysis of data from SR-PXD,
PND and DFT optimization was utilized to locate the Li [+] ions.
Besides the structure of LiCe(BH4)3Cl described above with
Li [+] positioned on the 12d Wyckoff site two other Li [+] positions
were considered but eventually rejected (see Table 2). One of
these two models corresponds to the only possible fully
ordered arrangement of Li [+] ions on the sites 2a and 6b. [42] The
2a site is situated in the center of the distorted cubane cage
Ce4Cl4, resulting in Ce−Li distance of only 2.8757(14) Å. For
comparison, in a similar mixed metal borohydride chloride
NaY(BH4)2Cl2 the shortest Na−Y distance is 4.95 Å. [43] Indeed,
DFT calculations on a model with the 2a site filled by Li [+] ions
shows larger discrepancy for the position of Ce atoms with
respect to the experimental data. Moreover, a Rietveld

ever, DFT optimization showed large displacements of
m and in particular hydrogen atom positions yielding a
el inconsistent with neutron diffraction data. The Rietveld
ement using the SR-PXD data reveal unacceptably short
H distances of ∼1.2 Å. Because of the lack of agreement
een the theoretical and experimental data the third model
also rejected.
FT optimization showed that the 12d model (see Figure
n the Supporting Information) has the lowest energy and
the 2a/6b and the 24g model energies are higher by 0.42
1.14 eV/f.u, respectively. Furthermore, the optimized
ter of the cage)−Ce distance for the 12d and 2a model are
5 and 3.114 Å, respectively. This difference makes a
eable change in the simulated X-ray diffraction patterns
the heaviest atom Ce most strongly scatters X-rays and
12d model reproduces the experimental pattern more
ly (see the R-values in Table 2). DFT optimization reveals
relaxation of the unit cell volume leads to a rather large
nsion of 11.1% while accompanying a small decrease in
gy by 0.051 eV/f.u. for the model containing the 2a site.
rary to that, the model with 12d site remains stable, with
0.1% variation of the cell parameter and the related total
gy changes of less than 1 meV/f.u. Another ordered variant
+ configuration in the 12d site was modeled using DFT
Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), which has
er energy by only 0.028 eV/f.u. and almost constant unit
volume within 0.6% of the experimental value. The
arities in energy and volume between different hypothetiordered 12d sites strongly support this model.
he formation energy for LiCe(BH4)3Cl from LiCl and
BH4)3 has also been estimated using DFT calculations.
e the crystal structure of Ce(BH4)3 is unknown, the low
perature polymorph of Y(BH4)3 was adopted as a
thetical “Ce(BH4)3” structure. Both LiCl and Ce(BH4)3
simulated with the same approximations as LiCe

H4)3 (a = 10.852 Å) and rather close to that observed for
(BH4)3Cl (a = 11.720 Å, this study), reflecting the
vely larger ionic radius of Ce and weaker binding as
pared to Y(BH4)3. This may partly explain why formation
Ce(BH4)3Cl is preferred to the formation of “Ce(BH4)3”

ions in different distances to the 11B site and that these
couplings are additive, [52] prevents a straightforward simulation
of the ssb manifolds by consideration of the mutual effects from
the 11B quadrupole coupling and 11B nuclear spin −
paramagnetic electron-spin dipolar couplings. However, the
observation of these heteronuclear dipolar couplings strongly
suggests that the paramagnetic electron is localized in a Ce [3+]
bonding and that it is nonconducting. It is unlikely that the
well-defined [11] B MAS NMR spectra shown in Figure 4 could
have observed if the unpaired electrons were conducting. An
estimation of the [11] B quadrupole coupling constant (CQ) can

Temperature effects are not taken into account and ΔE is the
DFT total energy difference. Since the bonding characters are
largely preserved between the reactants and the product, ΔH
(T = 298 K) would not be significantly different from ΔE (T =
0 K). Therefore, the structure of LiCe(BH4)3Cl may be
stabilized by higher entropy rather than lower enthalpy, and
this result again favors the 12d model because disorder in Li
positions would certainly contribute to the entropy.
In this study, a bimetallic borohydride chloride LiCe(BH4)3Cl is discovered, in contrast to other rare earth metal
borohydrides produced mechano-chemically from similar
metalborohydride-metalchloride reaction mixtures, i.e. LiSc(BH4)4, [15] Y(BH4)3, [44][−][48] and Gd(BH4)3,. [44,49] This dissimilarity
might be due to differences in ionic ratio (given in parentheses)
for the lanthanides as compared to lithium, i.e. Li [+] (0.76 Å) ≈
Sc [3+] (0.75 Å) &lt; Y [3+] (0.90 Å) &lt; Gd [3+] (0.94 Å) &lt; Ce [3+] (1.02 Å).
Apparently, anionic structures are preferred for the smallest
ions, as in LiSc(BH4)4, and formation of monometallic
framework structures seems to be more favorable for the
slightly larger lanthanides, e.g., Y(BH4)3 and Gd(BH4)3. The
largest lanthanides appear to facilitate formation of more
complex framework structures, as for LiCe(BH4)3Cl, which
contains isolated tetranuclear anionic clusters

[Ce4Cl4(BH4)12] [4][−] with a distorted cubane Ce4Cl4 core,
charge-balanced by Li [+] cations.
Solid-State [11] B MAS NMR. The [11] B MAS NMR spectra of
the central and satellite transitions for the deuterated sample
CeCl3−Li [11] BD4 (1:4, s4) recorded at 14.1 and 9.4 T (Figure 4)
reveal manifolds of spinning side bands (ssb) from a single [11] B
site, in agreement with the present crystal-structure determination. The appearance of the ssb manifolds in the three
spectra is highly asymmetric and thereby deviates from the
symmetric ssb patterns reported earlier for the [11] B central and
satellite transitions in borohydride compounds. [19,47,50] Although
asymmetries in the ssb intensities from the central and satellite
transitions may arise from the combined effect of the 11B
quadrupole coupling and chemical shift anisotropy interactions,
as demonstrated in [11] B MAS NMR spectra of borates, [51] the
asymmetry in the present spectra reflects strong [11] B nuclear
spin − paramagnetic electron-spin dipolar interactions [52,53]

present along with the [11] B quadrupole coupling. Thus, the [11] B
nuclear spin couples to the surrounding free electrons of the
paramagnetic Ce [3+] ions, in accordance with cerium present as
the Ce [3+] ion in LiCe(BH4)3Cl, i.e., the Ce [4+] ion would result in
a diamagnetic compound. In addition to the asymmetry of the
ssb manifolds, these couplings also result in a significant line
broadening of the individual ssbs. The fact, that the individual
11B spins couple to the paramagnetic electron from several Ce3+

420 kHz and an axially symmetric quadrupole coupling tensor
(ηQ = 0). Although these values are nearly identical, the
apparent chemical shift for LiCe(BD4)3Cl in s4 is significantly
shifted to high frequency as compared to the [11] B chemical shift
range observed for BD4− sites in diamagnetic borohydrides
(e.g., roughly from −35 to −47 ppm). This high-frequency shift
may reflect that the [11] B spin − paramagnetic electron-spin
interactions also contribute with a Knight shift of the 11B
resonance. [11] B MAS NMR spectra have also been acquired for
the hydrogen samples, i.e. LiCe(BH4)3Cl in s1 − s3 (not
shown), which reveal the same centerband (δ = 26 ppm) and
ssb manifold as observed for the deuterated sample (Figure 4)
along with a centerband resonance at δiso = −41.2 ppm and a
few associated ssbs from LiBH4 in the samples. LiBD4 is also
observed in the s4 sample, as most clearly seen in the 9.4 T
spectrum recorded with a spinning speed of νR = 12.0 kHz
(Figure 4b). However, evaluation of the intensities for the two
compounds in this spectrum gives the intensity ratio
I(LiBD4):I(LiCe(BH4)3Cl) = 0.03, demonstrating that the
amount of LiBD4 is very small in the s4 sample.

Only Warburg impedances related to the semi-infinite diffusion
at the electrodes are observed and frequencies higher than 1
MHz are needed to fully plot the semicircles assigned to the
lithium ion mobility in the material. Nevertheless, the shape of
the impedance spectra is typical of a good conductor and the
conductivity can be calculated from the intercept with the real
axis (Zre value). Figure 6 reveals for LiCe(BH4)3Cl a linear
relationship between the resistance and the pellet thickness.

le CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:3, s5) is therefore about 3 orders of
nitude higher than that of o-LiBH4 at RT and is similar to

ement is LiCe(BH4)3Cl 49 wt % (6 mol %), LiCl 17 wt

onductivities of solid-state LiCl and CeCl3 are very low at
the measured ionic conductivity undoubtedly originates
the LiCe(BH4)3Cl compound. The volume fraction of
(BH4)3Cl in the CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:3, s5) sample is actually
(82%) and a percolation phenomenon occurs giving a high
conductivity to the pellet. Needless to say that a singlee LiCe(BH4)3Cl pellet should lead to higher conductivity

Thermal Analysis and Sievert Measurements. Thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetric
(DSC) measurements for samples CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:3, s2) and
(1:4, s3) are shown in Supporting Information, Figure S3, and
Figure 8, respectively. Sample s3 show a mass loss of 0.7 wt %

in the temperature range 150 to 240 °C and a larger loss in the
range 240 to 290 °C of 3.0 wt %. Thus, the observed mass loss
for sample s3 is 3.7 wt % in the temperature range RT to 500
°C, which is less than the calculated hydrogen content of the
sample, 4.84 wt % H2. The observed and calculated mass losses
for sample s2 are 3.2 and 3.88 wt % H2, respectively.
Considering that the decomposed samples contain cerium
dihydride, CeH2, the calculated hydrogen contents of the
samples s2 and s3 are 3.23 and 4.23 wt % H2.
The DSC data for s3 (see Figure 8) show two small
endothermic peaks at 93 and 109 °C, which may correspond to
the onset temperature for the reaction between remaining
CeCl3 and LiBH4 in the sample (see reaction scheme 1) and to
the polymorphic phase transition from orthorhombic to
hexagonal LiBH4. An endothermic peak observed at 213 °C
may correspond to the melting of LiCe(BH4)3Cl. A smaller

leased after heating the samples for 3 h at a constant
erature of 500 °C. Hence, the total observed H2 release is
wt % H2 for sample s3. In a previous study of the CeCl3−
H4 system gas analysis revealed a very small amount of
ran during hydrogen desorption. [59] In the present study, the
loss from the samples are all below the theoretical content

les is assumed to be at a minimum.

does not show the expected hydrogen release in the

respectively. The sample s3 contain one equivalent excess
LiBH4, which may be rehydrogenated and the calculated
hydrogen release from a sample s3 containing CeH2 and 1
equiv. of LiBH4 is 2.12 wt % H2. In contrast, sample s2 release
3.75 wt % H2 in the first cycle (d1) and 1.25 and 1.25 wt % H2
in the second and third cycles, which is comparable to the
calculated H2 release of 3.88 and 0.97 wt % H2 assuming that s2
contain LiCe(BH4)3Cl prior to d1 and CeH3 for the later
desorption cycles (see the Supporting Information, Figure S4).
The decomposition products for s3 after the third desorption
(d3) in the Sieverts measurements (Figure 9) was investigated
by Rietveld refinement of SR-PXD data (Figure 10). Diffraction
from the decomposition products LiCl, CeH2, and CeB6 are
identified along with an unknown compound.

Decomposition Mechanism for LiCe(BH4)3Cl Observed
by In situ SR-PXD. The thermal decomposition of samples
CeCl3−LiBH4 (1:3, s3) and (1:4, s4) were studied by in situ
SR-PXD. Both samples display similar decomposition mechanism, though the decomposition products from s2 appear more
crystalline and are discussed in the following (Figure 11). The
first SR-PXD patterns in the series measured at RT show
diffraction peaks from LiCe(BH4)3Cl, CeCl3 and LiCl. The
diffraction peaks from CeCl3 decreases slowly at T &gt; 63 °C and
disappear at 315 °C. During heating from 100 to 160 °C the
amounts of LiCe(BH4)3Cl and LiCl increase, while that of
CeCl3 decreases because of the progress of reaction 1. The
Bragg diffraction peaks from LiCe(BH4)3Cl disappears at 240
°C, possibly because of melting and subsequent decomposition
and diffraction from an unknown compound appear at 240 °C.
Peaks from CeH2 emerge at 320 °C when CeCl3 disappears.
The unknown compound may be a ternary salt composed of
lithium, cerium and chloride and remains in the sample during
the rest of the heating. A ternary salt, NaYCl4, is also observed
during the decomposition of NaY(BH4)2Cl2. [43] Structural
determination of the unknown compound has unfortunately
not been possible, but further studies are currently being
performed to elucidate the atomic composition. The reaction
scheme (3) describes the idealized overall decomposition
reaction for s2 omitting the unknown compound.

CONCLUSION


novel compound LiCe(BH4)3Cl crystallizes in the cubic
al system with the space group I43̅ m and the structure
tains isolated tetranuclear anionic clusters
Cl4(BH4)12] [4][−] with a distorted cubane Ce4Cl4 core
ge-balanced by Li [+] cations. The Li [+] ions are disordered
occupy 2/3 of the 12d Wyckoff sites. The structural model ̈
derived by the combined use of synchrotron radiation
der X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD), powder neutron diffrac
̈

(PND), and density functional theory (DFT) and would
y not have been obtained with any combination of only two ̈
e methods. DFT indicates that LiCe(BH4)3Cl is stabilized
igher entropy rather than lower enthalpy, in accord with

̀

disorder at the Li positions. The structural model and DFT
lations agree well with the very high lithium ion

̈

uctivity measured for the LiCe(BH4)3Cl containing
le, 1.03 × 10 [−][4] S cm [−][1] at T = 20 °C. Conductivity
urements carried out between lithium foils suggest that the
uctivity mainly originates from the high lithium ion
lity, which is in favor of our model of disordered Li. Solid11B MAS NMR spectra of the central and satellite ̈
itions reveal that the 11B spin interacts with the
magnetic electron-spins (from the unpaired electron on
), which also contribute with a Knight shift of the [11] B
nance. Very high lithium ion conductivity is in favor of our
tural model including disordered Li. The new compound
(BH4)3Cl also stores 5.33 wt % hydrogen, which is
sed in the temperature range 220−260 °C. Rehydrogenaat moderate conditions leads to a reversible storage

ABSTRACT: In the search for novel solid electrolytes for solid-state batteries,
thiophosphate ionic conductors have been in recent focus owing to their high
ionic conductivities, which are believed to stem from a softer, more polarizable
anion framework. Inspired by the oft-cited connection between a soft anion
lattice and ionic transport, this work aims to provide evidence on how changing
the polarizability of the anion sublattice in one structure aﬀects ionic transport.
Here, we systematically alter the anion framework polarizability of the
superionic argyrodites Li6PS5X by controlling the fractional occupancy of the
halide anions (X = Cl, Br, I). Ultrasonic speed of sound measurements are used
to quantify the variation in the lattice stiﬀness and Debye frequencies. In
combination with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and neutron
diﬀraction, these results show that the lattice softness has a striking inﬂuence
on the ionic transport: the softer bonds lower the activation barrier and
simultaneously decrease the prefactor of the moving ion. Due to the
contradicting inﬂuence of these parameters on ionic conductivity, we ﬁnd that it is necessary to tailor the lattice stiﬀness of
materials in order to obtain an optimum ionic conductivity.
1. INTRODUCTION
Solid ion conductors (solid electrolytes) with high ionic
conductivities are indispensable in many applications, such as
batteries,1−3 solid oxide fuel cells,4 solar thermal generators,5
and oxygen sensors.4,6 Importantly, ionic conductivities of solid
electrolytes are strongly related to their underlying crystal
structure. The ionic conductivity (σ) of solids can be described
by an activated hopping process of ions from one lattice site to
an empty adjacent lattice site, governed by the activation barrier
for the jump (EA), the mobility (μ), the active carrier density
(n), and the charge of the ion (Ze):

In general, certain static structural conditions must be satisﬁed
in order for signiﬁcant ionic conductivity to occur in a solid: (1)
Carrier density and available lattice sites are needed. The
conductivity depends on the carrier concentration, and a large
number of mobile ions must be present in the solid. Moreover,
unoccupied adjacent crystallographic sites must be available for
mobile ions to jump to.6−8 Thus, solids with ionic
conductivities resulting primarily from (point) defects usually
exhibit lower conductivities in comparison to superionic
conductors, in which a much larger number of possible
crystallographic sites are occupied by the diﬀusing species.6,7
For instance, α-AgI,6 (Ag/Cu)7PSe6,9,10 and the Li+ conducting
garnets Li5La3Ta2O12,11,12 possess ion distributions over a large
number of crystallographic sites and exhibit high ionic
conductivities, even at room temperature. (2) Low activation
energy is also required. While a large number of empty sites is
paramount for the diﬀusion of ions, these sites need to be easily
accessible as well. The diﬀerent sites should ideally have similar
potential energies with low energetic barriers for jumps
between adjacent sites. The close proximity of lattice sites
and favorable ion mobility can be achieved in materials with
face-sharing polyhedra, as opposed to edge-sharing, since the
opening (i.e., window of the diﬀusion pathway) in the face-
shared case is larger.7,13 Additionally, these broad diﬀusion
pathways should be structured such that the diﬀusing ion does
not disrupt the local arrangement of neighboring ions within
the lattice.14−16 The eﬀects of polyhedral connectivity on the

garnet-type solid electrolytes.17
In addition to these more static structural parameters, a
larger polarizability of the anions in the same structure allows
for similar hopping-site environments and has been suggested
to lower the activation barriers.15 A large number of sulﬁde,
thiophosphate, and iodide materials are said to be superionic
conductors for this reason (e.g., Li10(Sn/Ge)P2S12, thio-
LISICON Li4GeS4, and the above-mentioned α-AgI).6,7,18−24
Although high ionic conductivity implies relatively weak
eﬀective coupling between mobile ions and the ﬁxed lattice,7
lattice−cation interactions are not negligible.
During the 1970s/1980s, several researchers put forward the
idea of exploring the dynamics of the host lattice instead of
focusing on the static properties.22,25−28 For instance, the ionic
conductivity should be closely related to the phonon spectrum,
given that ionic diﬀusion is a thermally activated process.29 The
phonon spectrum resulting from lattice vibrations directly
correlates to the elastic stiﬀness or softness of the lattice.
Fischer et al. reported the importance of covalency and anion
overlap in silver halides.30 Moreover, Zeller et al. have shown
the inﬂuence of anion polarizability on the oscillator strength of
the lattice and, consequently, the transition rate of the hopping
ion.22,31 This in turn correlates well with ionic transition state
theory that relates the prefactor of ionic motion to the Debye
frequency of the lattice.32 However, the majority of such
research eﬀorts have focused on the lattice dynamics of
individual superionic conductors like α-AgI as characterized by
inelastic neutron scattering.30,33−35 Further, there have been
suggestions of the inﬂuence of soft phonon modes on
superionic phase transitions, but not the diﬀusion process per
se.36,37 No attempts have been made to systematically alter the
dynamics of the host lattice of diﬀerent materials and
understand its inﬂuence on ionic conduction. Recent studies
have only hinted at the role of lattice dynamics on speciﬁc
properties. For instance, it has been shown that compositional
changes in ceria lead to softer lattice vibrations, expressed as a
decrease of the phonon density of states.38 Theoretical results
by Benedek et al. suggest a “phonon-assisted diﬀusion
mechanism” via octahedral rotations in O2−-conducting
Ruddlesden−Popper phases.39 Similarly, the so-called “pad-
dle-wheel mechanism” discussed by Jansen,40 suggests that the
anions act like a revolving door, helping the cations to move
through the lattice. A recent work highlighted the inﬂuence of
the phonon frequency on the activation barrier, corroborating
that a softer lattice and lower phonon frequencies lead to a
reduction in the associated activation barriers.41
However, historically, it has been diﬃcult to probe the
inﬂuence of a dynamic lattice on a speciﬁc property. Inspired by
the existing, but not fully understood, relationship of a soft and
dynamic lattice on the ionic conductivity, we aim to provide
evidence on how changing the polarizability of the anion
sublattice in one structure aﬀects the ionic transport. In this
work, we employ the argyrodite Li6PS5X as a model system in
which the halide content, and, hence, the polarizability of the
anion framework, can be altered without major changes to the
structure or the Li+ diﬀusion pathways. By combining structural
characterization with speed of sound measurements to obtain
information about the materials softness and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy, we show that the lattice softness has a
strong inﬂuence on the ionic transport. The presented work
corroborates that a softer lattice lowers the activation barrier for
a jump However a softer lattice also decreases the attempt
because of a reduction of the average vibrational frequencies of
the lattice. The simultaneous decrease in the attempt frequency,
entropy of migration, and activation barrier have contradicting
inﬂuences on the ionic conductivity. This work is a stepping
stone to gain a better understanding of the inﬂuence of a
dynamic lattice on ionic transport. It highlights the importance
of tailoring the lattice stiﬀness and suggests a necessary
paradigm shift regarding the knowledge that a soft lattice is not
necessarily always better for a solid ionic conductor.
2. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
Synthesis. All preparations and sample treatments for Li6PS5X (X
= Cl, Cl0.25Br0.75, Cl0.5Br0.5, Cl0.75Br0.25, Br, Br0.75I0.25, Br0.5I0.5, Br0.25I0.75,
and I) were carried out under argon atmosphere. Lithium sulﬁde (Li2S,
Sigma-Aldrich, 99.98%), phosphorus pentasulﬁde (P2S5, Sigma-
Aldrich, 99%), as well as LiCl (ChemPur, 99.99%), LiBr (ChemPur,
99.995%), and LiI (Alpha Aesar, 99.995%) were mixed in the
appropriate stoichiometric ratio. All mixtures were hand ground in an
agate mortar, pressed into pellets, and then ﬁlled into quartz ampules
(10 mm inner diameter and 10−12 cm in length), which were sealed
under vacuum. All ampules were carbon-coated and preheated at 800
°C under dynamic vacuum to avoid all traces of water in the reaction
atmosphere. The reactions were performed at 550 °C for 2 weeks in
order to ensure a complete reaction and phase purity. The obtained
mixture was subsequently ground and isostatically pressed into pellets
(10 mm diameter) for the electrochemical and speed of sound
measurements or kept as a powder for the diﬀraction studies. In order
to obtain standard deviations on each data set, reﬂecting changes in
microstructure and small compositional changes, each composition
was synthesized multiple times. Three syntheses per composition were
used for each of the speed of sound, impedance spectroscopy, and
neutron diﬀraction measurements.
Neutron Powder Diﬀraction. High-resolution neutron powder
diﬀraction data collection on the argyrodite samples was performed in
a Debye−Scherrer geometry at the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum
(research reactor FRM II, Garching b. München, Germany) on the
high-resolution diﬀractometer SPODI.42 Data collection using one
wavelength was performed, i.e., monochromatic neutrons [λ =
1.548 17(2) Å], and were obtained from the thermal neutron beam
at a 155° takeoﬀangle using the 551 and 331 reﬂections of a vertically
focused composite Ge monochromator of 200 mm height. The vertical
position-sensitive multidetector (300 mm vertical sensitivity range at
1.117 m sample-to-detector distance) consisting of 80 3He tubes and
covering an angular range of 160° 2θ was used for data collection. The
samples (approximately 2 cm3 in volume) were ﬁlled into a thin-walled
(0.15 mm) vanadium can 12 mm in diameter under argon atmosphere
and then metal-sealed using indium wire. The vanadium container was
then mounted on a capillary spinner enabling sample rotation, thus
minimizing the eﬀects of preferred crystallite orientations. Two-
dimensional powder diﬀraction data of the continuously rotated
sample were collected and corrected for geometrical aberrations and
detector nonlinearities.43
Rietveld Analysis. Rietveld reﬁnements were carried out using
GSAS II software.44 The peak proﬁle shape was described by a pseudo-
Voigt function using the modiﬁed Thomson−Cox−Hastings setting.
The instrumental resolution was determined using Na2Ca3Al2F14 as
the reference material. Fit indicatorsRwp, Rexp, and χ2were used to
assess the quality of the reﬁned structural models.45 The following
parameters were initially reﬁned: (1) scale factor, (2) background
coeﬃcients using a Chebyschev function with 10 free parameters, (3)
peak shape, which was modeled using a modiﬁed Thomson−Cox−
Hastings pseudo-Voigt function,46 (4) lattice constants, (5) fractional
atomic coordinates, (6) isotropic atomic displacement parameters, and
(7) zero-shift error. Finally, (8) atomic occupancies of the anions were
then allowed to reﬁne simultaneously with all other parameters, to
quantify the anion site disorder

--------------------------------------------------
Synchrotron Pair Distribution Function Analysis. Mark-tubes
made of borosilicate glass (Hilgenberg) with an outer diameter of 0.9
mm were ﬁlled in an argon glovebox and ﬂame-sealed. X-ray scattering
data suitable for pair distribution function and diﬀraction analysis were
performed at room temperature using the I15 instrument at the
Diamond Light Source (UK) beamline. High-energy X-rays (λ =
0.173 369 Å, 71.52 keV, bent Laue monochromator) were used in
combination with a PerkinElmer 1621 EN area detector.
The crystallographic data, obtained from the reﬁnements of the
Bragg data, were used as starting values for the analysis of the PDF
data of Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Cl0.5Br0.5, Br, Br0.5I0.5, and I). The pair
distribution function [G(r)] was employed for a more accurate
structural analysis, and the PDFgetX2 software was used to extract
G(r) from the raw diﬀraction data.47 The collected data were ﬁrst
corrected for background, sample absorption, and Compton scattering.
Then, normalized structure functions [S(Q)] were obtained. Finally,
S(Q) was Fourier-transformed to yield G(r). A maximum scattering
vector (Qmax) of 17 Å−1 was employed in the Fourier transform.
Structural reﬁnements were carried out using the PDFgui software.48
The local crystal structure of the Li6PS5X crystallites was reﬁned in the
F4̅3m space group. The ﬁt of this structural model to the experimental
PDF data was performed in the 1.8−30 Å interatomic distance range.
The following parameters were reﬁned: (1) scale factor, (2) lattice
parameters (a), (3) local correlated motion factor, (4) fractional
atomic coordinates of the sulfur atoms, and (5) atomic isotropic
displacement parameters. Fractional atomic coordinates for the lithium
atoms were ﬁxed to values determined from the reﬁnement of neutron
diﬀraction data, and atomic displacement parameters for the lithium
atoms were ﬁxed to Uiso = 0.05. The Rw indicator was employed to
assess the quality of the reﬁned structural models.49
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. Electrical conduc-
tivities were measured by ac impedance spectroscopy, using a custom-
built setup. Powder samples were placed between two stainless steel
rods with 10 mm diameter and pressed at 3 tons for 3 min.
Electrochemical impedance analysis (EIS) was conducted in the
temperature range from −10 to 60 °C using a SP300 impedance
analyzer (Biologic) at frequencies from 7 MHz to 100 mHz with an
amplitude of 10 mV. For the samples analyzed here, all compositions
have been synthesized and characterized three times in order to obtain
standard deviations and reﬂect changes in composition and micro-
structure. All values shown reﬂect the average values and the
corresponding standard deviations.
Ultrasonic Speed of Sound Measurements. Pulse-echo speed
of sound measurements were performed on consolidated disks using
an Epoch 600 (Olympus) with 5 MHz transducers for longitudinal and
transverse speeds of sound. Since the samples are highly air sensitive
and enclosing the pellets in pouches would prevent penetration of
transverse signals, the samples were coated with a thin layer (&lt;200
nm) of gold in order to prevent side reactions of the couplant and the
sample. All measurements were performed under a nitrogen
atmosphere. The measurement uncertainty from the speed of sound
data results stems from the uncertainty in the thickness and the
porosity. As the measurement uncertainty for the thickness of the
pellet is much higher than that of the gold layer, the thin layer of Au is
not expected to add signiﬁcantly to the measurement uncertainty. In
addition, no damping of the signal is expected due to the high
crystallinity and high speed of sound in Au. This measurement
procedure has recently been shown to be successful in understanding
the lattice softness of Li10GeP2S12.50 While in typical sound
measurements on 100% dense samples an uncertainty of 2% can be
achieved, here each sample composition has been synthesized and
measured three times in order to obtain standard deviations on these
85% dense samples. All values shown reﬂect the average values with
the corresponding standard deviations.
Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) measurements were
performed on an additional set of samples (two samples of each
composition) using a commercial RUSpec system built by Quasar
International.51,52 Measurements were carried out in an argon-ﬁlled
glovebox to avoid sample decomposition. In contrast to the pulse-echo
method, RUS measurements do not require a couplant ﬂuid for signal
transmission, so no Au ﬁlm was required. A drive transducer sweeps
across a frequency range of 30−350 kHz, and two pickup transducers
record peaks whenever a resonant frequency of the sample is reached.
The elastic tensor elements C11, C12, and C44 were determined from
the RUS spectra using commercial software (RPModel, Quasar
International). For each scan, the overall goodness-of-ﬁt, as
characterized by the root-mean-square (rms) diﬀerence between the
predicted and observed resonant frequencies, was less than 0.5%. The
speeds of sound were calculated from the elastic constants using

Ultrasonic measurements are a widely used and extremely accurate
approach to determine the elastic properties and speed of sound in
materials.52,53 Such methods are a direct probe of the strength of the
bonds themselves.54−57 Further, the obtained longitudinal and
transverse speeds of sound (vlong and vtrans) can be used to calculate
the mean speed of sound (vmean), as well as the Debye temperature
(ΘD) and Debye frequency (υD) via eqs 2−4.58−60

occur. The intercage jumps are suggested to dominate long-range transport, and site disorder between the 4a and 4c sites is known to aﬀect the
conductivity signiﬁcantly.64

3. RESULTS
Structural Characterization. The Li+ superionic argyr-
odites Li6PS5X have been synthesized with various ratios of X
(X = Cl Cl
Br
Cl Br
Cl
Br
Br Br
I
Br I
Br0.25I0.75, and I) to study the eﬀect of the anion polarizability
on the lattice stiﬀness and the associated ionic conductivity.
The substitution of X in Li6PS5X only changes the polarizability
and lattice parameter of the anion sublattice, without
signiﬁcantly changing the conduction pathways or altering the
charge carrier concentration, thereby making the Li+ superionic
argyrodites an ideal model system. This class of materials has
been well-studied in eﬀorts to elucidate Li+ conducting phases
and their conduction mechanisms, for instance by Deiseroth et
al.,61−63 and are, therefore, a good starting point for studying
lattice dynamics eﬀects. It should also be noted that the Ag and
Cu superionic compounds exist as well Figure 1a shows the
Figure 2. (a) Neutron powder diﬀraction data and results of the Rietveld reﬁnement for Li6PS5I as a representative reﬁnement. Small fractions of the
impurity phases Li3PO4 and LiI can be seen and correspond to 1.5 and 1.6 wt %, respectively. (b) Pair distribution function [G(r)] of Li6PS5I,
showing the goodness-of-ﬁt of the structural reﬁnement. An additional distance contribution around 3.4 Å can be seen that cannot be explained by
the structural motif and appears to be decreasing from Cl to I.

centered cubic lattice (Wyckoﬀpositions 4a and 4c), with S2−
anions in half of the tetrahedral voids and PS4
3−tetrahedra on
the octahedral sites (P on Wyckoﬀ4b). The I−and S2−anions
are known to be separated between the diﬀerent crystallo-
graphic sites, 4a and 4c, respectively. However, the Br−- and
Cl−-containing compounds are supposed to show signiﬁcant
site disorder.63 The disorder, which has been shown
experimentally for Li6PS5Cl and Li6PS5Br,64−66 is very likely
due to the similar ionic radii of Cl−(1.81 pm), Br−(1.96 pm),
and S2−(1.84 pm).63,67
With regard to the lithium ions, two crystallographic
positions for Li+ are possible61 (Wyckoﬀ48h and 24g), of
which the 24g site represents an intermediate state with
triangular coordination through which diﬀusion can occur. The
two lithium positions form cagelike local polyhedra (Figure
1b), where three diﬀerent Li+ jump processes are possible.64,68
These include next-neighbor jumps (48h−24g−48h), intracage
jumps, and intercage jumps, the latter of which seem to
dominate the macroscopic long-range ion transport.64 The
occurring site disorder aﬀects the intercage jumps and long-
range transport. For example, I−-containing samples without
any disorder exhibit higher activation barriers for conduc-
tion.64,65 A high site disorder seems to be beneﬁcial for the
jump rate of the intercage jump.64 This is possibly due to the
more directional covalent character of the S2−anion, which
leads to a large degree of ﬂuctuating chemical environments.69
Figure 2a shows a representative Rietveld reﬁnement against
neutron powder diﬀraction data, which has been collected for
all samples in the series of solid solutions. In addition, X-ray
pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of samples with 0.5
steps of halide content were also collected (see Figure 2b). The
PDF were obtained to determine if local structural changes are
induced by the substitution. All samples exhibit minor
impurities (phase fraction below 5 wt %) of Li3PO4 and LiX,
and the obtained structural data is tabulated in the Supporting
Information. While no large local structural changes can be
seen in the PDF, an additional distance arises around 3.4 Å that
does not correspond to any local distances in the structure of
Li6PS5X and seems to be decreasing from Cl to I (see the
Supporting Information). For instance, in Li6PS5Br, the local
distances are d(P−S) = 2.054(9) Å, d(S−S) = 3.35(1) Å
(within a PS4
3−unit), and d(S−S) = 3.73(2) Å (between two
PS4
3−units). All other S−X distances are greater than 4 Å.
Presently, we believe that this may be due to some additional
glassy phase, as recently shown in Li4P2S6,70 an assumption that
is corroborated by the changing amorphous signals in 31P NMR
reported by Deiseroth and co-workers.63
Figure 3 shows all structural data obtained from reﬁnements
against the neutron diﬀraction data and the X-ray PDF,
whenever applicable. All reﬁned structural data can further be
found tabulated in the Supporting Information. The linear
increase in the lattice parameters due to the increasing anion
radius follows Vegard’s law, indicating the successful synthesis
of all solid solutions in Li6PS5X (Figure 3a). Due to the time-
and space-averaging character of the Bragg data, the lattice
parameters, as obtained from PDF and neutron Bragg
scattering data, deviate slightly. With the strong negative
nuclear scattering form factor of Li, lithium occupancies on the
two sites (i.e., 48h and 24g) are also obtained from the
reﬁnements (see Figure 3b). At high Cl content, no Li can be
identiﬁed on the 24g position (the central position of the
triangular site shown in Figure 1b) In other words a 50%
site in the cage is unoccupied on average. With increasing Br
and I substitution, the Li occupancy of the 48h site decreases,
while it increases on the 24g one. The occupancy on the 24g
site can be explained structurally. Figure 3d shows the surface
area of the triangle sites for the jump from 48h to 24g to 48h, in
which the 24g position represents the transition state on the
triangular site. With increasing lattice volume, the distance
between Li and S (on Wyckoﬀ16e and 4c, respectively)
increases, which stabilizes the occupation of the transition state.
Figure 4 shows the changing Li+−Li+ jump distances. With
increasing unit cell volume, the intra- and intercage jump
distances increase, while the 48h−48h separation decreases.
Figure 3c shows the obtained site disorder between X and S
on Wyckoﬀposition 4c in which the percentage of shown
disorder represents the total fraction of all X−on the S2−site.
The individual occupancies of Cl, Br, and I can be found in the
Supporting Information. The X-ray PDF data for Cl−-
containing samples were not reﬁned for disorder, as Cl−and
S2−are indistinguishable via X-ray diﬀraction. In accordance
with the literature,63 signiﬁcant site disorder between Cl−, as
well as Br−and S2−, is observed. With increasing lattice volume,
and an increasing diﬀerence in the ionic radius variation of the
anions, the site disorder decreases. No disorder is observable
for Li6PS5I, as the ionic radii of I−and S2−are too diﬀerent.
The change from Cl to Br and then to I leads to a clear
change in the volume of the lattice, as well as the site disorder.
The diminishing disorder is expected to increase the activation
barrier of the observable transport.64 In addition, these data
show that with increasing lattice size, the probability of ﬁnding
Li+ on the transition state site 24g increases, which may
ultimately aﬀect the ionic transport, given that the lifetime of
the excited transition state is clearly increasing. While changes
in the structure are clearly visible, these eﬀects are not expected
to have a major inﬂuence on the diﬀusion pathways per se, as
they do not alter the routes of Li diﬀusion in the structure.
Correlation of a Soft Lattice with Ionic Transport. In
order to correlate changes of the ionic conductivity with lattice
softness, temperature-dependent impedance spectroscopy was
performed

with the activation energy being EA and the prefactor being σ0.
The temperature-dependent ionic conductivity of Li6PS5X was
measured using impedance spectroscopy, and the resulting
Arrhenius plots (shown in 0.5 steps for clarity) are shown in
Figure 5a, with a representative impedance response for
Li6PS5Br0.5I0.5 shown in Figure 5b. The extracted activation
barriers for ionic motion are shown in Figure 6b and are
discussed in the context of the varying lattice stiﬀness (vide
infra). The impedance data were ﬁt to an equivalent circuit
consisting of one parallel CPE/resistor in series with a CPE
representing the blocking electrodes. The apex frequency is 1.1
× 106 Hz, which corresponds to a capacitance of 1.2 × 10−9 F.
Bulk and grain boundary contributions cannot be deconvoluted
and the conductivities reported correspond to the overall
sample conductivity. While the mechanistic considerations
relate to the bulk transport, it is reasonable to assume that the
grain boundary contributions do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the
observed trends, as the standard deviations obtained will reﬂect
spreads in sample density as well.
Ultrasonic determination of the stiﬀness of a material can be
performed by (1) directly measuring the speed of sound using a
pulse-echo method or (2) measuring the resonant vibrational
frequencies of the sample (resonant ultrasound spectroscopy,
RUS).51−53 In both cases, for a sample of known density and
dimensions, the elastic constants and the transverse and
longitudinal sound velocities can be determined with a high
degree of accuracy. In the present study, both methods were
used to independently conﬁrm the trend in the velocity as a
function of composition. In addition to providing information
about the bond strength and elastic constants of a material,72
the measured speeds of sound determine the slope of the
acoustic phonon branches and are, therefore, a good and
reliable measure of phononic properties and lattice stiﬀness. A
high speed of sound, which directly indicates a more rigid
lattice with stiﬀer bonds (reduced spring constant), corre-
sponds to high Debye temperatures and high Debye
frequencies (see eqs 3 and 4) 54 Ultrasonic speed of sound
measurements have been used previously to obtain elastic
constants of lithium conducting thiophosphates73−75 and, just
recently, the Debye temperature of Li10GeP2S12.50 Baranowski
et al.73 found that speed of sound measurements (which are
generally considered to be more accurate than indenta-
tion)51−53 correlate well with indentation experiments, if the
density of the samples is considered.
Figure 6 shows the obtained speeds of sound (longitudinal,
transverse, and mean speeds), the linear-ﬁt extracted activation
barriers, the Arrhenius prefactors, and the room-temperature
ionic conductivities for all compositions of Li6PS5X. In order to
account for variations in the microstructure, density, and
syntheses, three diﬀerent samples were synthesized and
measured for each composition. Despite increasing the lattice
volume and anion polarizability, the speeds of sound decrease
(Figure 6a), corresponding to an increase in the softness of the
lattice and, with it, decreasing Debye temperatures and Debye
frequencies of the solids (vide infra). Although slightly higher
speeds of sound would be expected for fully dense samples,73
the qualitative trend reﬂects the softening of the lattice when
substituting Cl for Br and I.
The linear-ﬁt extracted EA and prefactors σ0 for the diﬀerent
materials can be found in Figure 6b. It is evident that the
substitution of heavier halide anions leads to a decrease in the
activation barrier and a decrease in the prefactor σ0, as expected
within the Meyer−Neldel rule,76−80 with the exception of the
iodine-containing Li6PS5X. Here, the absence of site disorder
leads to an increasing activation barrier, as expected from
theoretical considerations.64 The decrease of the activation
barrier and the prefactor σ0 correlates well with the increasing
softness of the lattice (Figure 6a). The concurrent decrease of
both variables in eq 5, i.e., the Arrhenius prefactor σ0 and the
activation barrier EA, leads to an optimum of the ionic
conductivity at a composition of Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5. These data
demonstrate an experimental correlation between the softness
of a lattice and the activation barrier in ionic conductors.
However, with decreasing lattice softness, the Arrhenius
prefactor is strongly inﬂuenced, which in turn detrimentally
aﬀects the ionic conductivity.
4. DISCUSSION
The collected data provide evidence that a correlation indeed
exists between a softer lattice and the ionic transport With

governed by a factor to take into account diﬀerent diﬀusion
geometries and correlation factors (z), the carrier density of
mobile ions (n), the entropy of migration (ΔSm), the jump
distance (a0), the charge of the ions (Ze), and the attempt
frequency (ν0). The attempt frequency corresponds to the
oscillator frequency of a moving cation on its lattice site and
can, in terms of a transition state theory, be described as the
inverse of the lifetime of the excited ion state.32 The frequency
of the occurring jump (jump frequency) then is a product of
the probability of the occurring jump and the attempt
frequency.71 The migration enthalpy is related to that soft
vibrational mode that carries the ion across the saddle point83,84
and, hence, the attempt frequency. The entropy of migration
itself also depends on the phonon properties, as it is directly
related to the ratio of the vibrational partition functions of the
excited and the initial state.83,85 In other words, both the
migrational entropy as well as the enthalpy, i.e., the activation
energy, are directly aﬀected by the lattice vibrations. In this
work, changing the anion isoelectronically does not change the
number of charge carriers nor the diﬀusion pathways or the
defect formation enthalpies. The increasing anion size increases
the jump distance (see Figure 4) and the increasing
polarizability induces a softening of the lattice (Figure 6a).
This leads to lower speeds of sound, lower Debye temperatures,
and lower Debye frequencies (see eqs 3 and 4). The Debye
frequencies (νD), as obtained from the mean speeds of sound,
for the diﬀerent compositions are shown in Figure 7a and
decrease as the lattice becomes softer. Since the attempt
frequency (ν0) is usually approximated using the Debye
frequency (νD),86,87 a softening of the lattice should lead to a
decrease in the prefactor. Using the formalism of transition
state theory of ionic motion, the oscillator frequency can be
estimated from the activation barrier via32

Figure 7b shows the jump frequency (ν0) versus the Debye
frequency (νD) of the diﬀerent compositions, calculated via eq
7 from the measured activation barriers, as well as the jump
distance of the intercage jump (Figure 4). A direct correlation
can be seen, within the estimated errors obtained by
propagation of the standard deviations, in that the activation
barriers are inﬂuenced by a softening of the lattice. The
inﬂuence of the lattice vibrations on the prefactor and the
activation barrier may indeed be one explanation for the origin
of the Meyer−Neldel rule (or compensation rule),76−80 which
states that a decreasing activation barrier often coincides with a
lower prefactor. It should be noted, however, that the Debye
frequencies as obtained from pulse-echo measurements are an
order of magnitude smaller than the obtained frequencies.
Some of the deviation may be due to the lower density of the
samples73 or the used intracage jump distances which may not

response echo method (PE) and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy

sound decreases and then slightly increases for Li6PS5I. (b) With
decreasing lattice stiﬀness (i.e., decreasing speed of sound), the
activation energy and the prefactor σ0 decrease. The increase in the
iodine-containing samples can be attributed to the lack of anion
disorder. The concurrent decrease of EA and σ0 leads to an overall
decrease of the (c) conductivity with increasing softness of the anion
lattice. The decrease of EA, as well as σ0, due to a softening of the
lattice suggests an optimal lattice softness in ionic conductors for
maximum conductivity. The literature values are shown for
comparison.66 All error bars represent standard deviations obtained
from measurements on three samples per composition.

--------------------------------------------------
reﬂect the rate-limiting jump for long-range transport. It shows
that the typical approximation of νD = ν0 is not entirely correct,
as it is solely based on a parabolic potential well. Furthermore,
with the changing site disorder, the predominant jump process
may change, which would further aﬀect the overall jump
frequency and prefactor. In addition, diﬀusion in the solid state
is, in general, a many-body problem. Depending on the exact
local bonding, the herein extracted Debye frequencies and
measured speeds of sound represent an average over all
chemical bonding interactions present in Li6PS5X. In other
words, averaging of the more ionic Li+−anion bonding and the
covalent P−S interactions may lead to further deviations in the
average Debye frequency relative to the jump frequency of Li+
in its anion framework.
Figure 7b shows that with decreasing lattice softness, the
activation barrier and Debye frequency, as well as the attempt
frequency of ionic motion, decrease (see Figure 8). However,
the experimentally determined prefactor (see Figure 6b)
changes much faster and over orders of magnitude compared
to the changing jump frequency. At this stage, we assume that
the changing vibrational frequencies of the lattice aﬀects the
entropy of migration more strongly through the ratio of the
vibronic partition functions. Furthermore, while the site
disorder in the I-containing material leads to an increase in
the activation barrier, the prefactor continues to decrease (see
the Supporting Information Figure S2) This shows that while
local structural changes aﬀect the activation energy as well, the
entropy of migration is only dependent on the lattice vibrations.
The lattice softening leads to a lower Debye frequency,
which lowers the jump frequency, and the entropy of migration.
All of these decrease the Arrhenius prefactor as well the
activation barrier for the ion jump (Figure 8). Interestingly, the
decreasing jump frequency should lead to an increased lifetime
(τ0) of the excited state (ν0 = 1/τ0),32 and indeed, the
occupancy of the 24g position increases along the solid
solutions series (see Figure 3b). Whether the increasing
population of the 24g position, and increasing lifetime of this
transition site, derives from a larger lattice (i.e., more space for
occupation) or whether it is due to a softer lattice remains
unclear at this stage.
The observed correlation between a softer lattice and the
oscillator frequency of a moving ion shows that a softer lattice
indeed lowers the activation barrier, as assumed in the past, but
also aﬀects the Arrhenius prefactor, leading to an optimum
lattice softness for Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5 and a rapid decrease in the
conductivity for lattices that are too soft. In addition, these data
experimentally conﬁrm the theoretical proposition64 that a
decreasing site disorder increases the activation barrier for a
jump, which explains the low conductivities in the iodine-
containing argyrodites when taking the Arrhenius prefactor into
consideration.
5. CONCLUSION
In this work, the eﬀect of lattice polarizability on the ionic
conductivity has been studied in the Li6PS5X argyrodites. Using
a combination of neutron diﬀraction and synchrotron pair-
distribution function analysis, lattice variations and, more
speciﬁcally, the Li+ occupancies and X−/S2−site disorder were
monitored. In addition, speeds of sound measurements were
used to obtain information about changes in the lattice softness,
upon substituting the anion sublattice from rigid Cl−to the
more polarizable I−.
Impedance spectroscopy showed that changing the lattice
dynamics (in this case by softening the lattice) aﬀects ionic
motion within solids. A softer lattice lowers the migration
barrier for a moving cation, as previously proposed, but this
work further demonstrates that the softer lattice aﬀects both the
oscillator frequency of a moving ion and the Arrhenius
prefactor as well. This suggests that the commonly accepted
paradigm of “a softer lattice for higher conductivities” may not

With increasing lattice softness, i.e., changing bond strength, the local
jump oscillators broaden, thereby altering the vibrational frequency, as
well as the activation barrier for a jump.

--------------------------------------------------
the ﬁrst systematic study of the eﬀects of lattice softening on
ionic conduction within one material class. This may provide a
novel optimization approach in the ﬁeld of ionic conductors,
and more importantly, it shows that a deeper understanding of
the eﬀects of a dynamic lattice on the jump frequencies, and
ultimately the ionic transport, is still required.

BSTRACT: In the search for novel solid electrolytes for solid-state batteries,
ophosphate ionic conductors have been in recent focus owing to their high
nic conductivities, which are believed to stem from a softer, more polarizable
ion framework. Inspired by the oft-cited connection between a soft anion
tice and ionic transport, this work aims to provide evidence on how changing
e polarizability of the anion sublattice in one structure affects ionic transport.
ere, we systematically alter the anion framework polarizability of the
perionic argyrodites Li6PS5X by controlling the fractional occupancy of the
lide anions (X = Cl, Br, I). Ultrasonic speed of sound measurements are used
quantify the variation in the lattice stiffness and Debye frequencies. In
mbination with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and neutron
ffraction, these results show that the lattice softness has a striking influence
the ionic transport: the softer bonds lower the activation barrier and
multaneously decrease the prefactor of the moving ion. Due to the
ntradicting influence of these parameters on ionic conductivity, we find that it is necessary to tailor the lattice stiffness of
aterials in order to obtain an optimum ionic conductivity.

rolytes are strongly related to their underlying crystal
ture. The ionic conductivity (σ) of solids can be described

conductors, in which a much larger number of possible
crystallographic sites are occupied by the diffusing species. [6][,][7]

For instance, α-AgI, [6] (Ag/Cu)7PSe6, [9][,][10] and the Li [+] conducting
garnets Li5La3Ta2O12, [11][,][12] possess ion distributions over a large
number of crystallographic sites and exhibit high ionic
conductivities, even at room temperature. (2) Low activation
energy is also required. While a large number of empty sites is
paramount for the diffusion of ions, these sites need to be easily
accessible as well. The different sites should ideally have similar
potential energies with low energetic barriers for jumps
between adjacent sites. The close proximity of lattice sites
and favorable ion mobility can be achieved in materials with
face-sharing polyhedra, as opposed to edge-sharing, since the
opening (i.e., window of the diffusion pathway) in the faceshared case is larger. [7][,][13] Additionally, these broad diffusion
pathways should be structured such that the diffusing ion does
not disrupt the local arrangement of neighboring ions within
the lattice. [14][−][16] The effects of polyhedral connectivity on the

addition to these more static structural parameters, a
r polarizability of the anions in the same structure allows
imilar hopping-site environments and has been suggested
wer the activation barriers. [15] A large number of sulfide,
hosphate, and iodide materials are said to be superionic
uctors for this reason (e.g., Li10(Sn/Ge)P2S12, thioCON Li4GeS4, and the above-mentioned α-AgI). [6][,][7][,][18][−][24]

tive coupling between mobile ions and the fixed lattice, [7]

uring the 1970s/1980s, several researchers put forward the
of exploring the dynamics of the host lattice instead of
ing on the static properties. [22][,][25][−][28] For instance, the ionic
uctivity should be closely related to the phonon spectrum,

2,31 This in turn correlates well with ionic transition state
ry that relates the prefactor of ionic motion to the Debye
uency of the lattice. [32] However, the majority of such
rch efforts have focused on the lattice dynamics of
idual superionic conductors like α-AgI as characterized by
stic neutron scattering. [30][,][33][−][35] Further, there have been
estions of the influence of soft phonon modes on
rionic phase transitions, but not the diffusion process per

37 No attempts have been made to systematically alter the
mics of the host lattice of different materials and
rstand its influence on ionic conduction. Recent studies
only hinted at the role of lattice dynamics on specific

̈

erties. For instance, it has been shown that compositional
ges in ceria lead to softer lattice vibrations, expressed as a
ease of the phonon density of states. [38] Theoretical results
Benedek et al. suggest a “phonon-assisted diffusion
hanism” via octahedral rotations in O [2][−] -conducting
dlesden−Popper phases. [39] Similarly, the so-called “padwheel mechanism” discussed by Jansen, [40] suggests that the
ns act like a revolving door, helping the cations to move
ugh the lattice. A recent work highlighted the influence of
phonon frequency on the activation barrier, corroborating
a softer lattice and lower phonon frequencies lead to a
ction in the associated activation barriers. [41]

owever, historically, it has been difficult to probe the
ence of a dynamic lattice on a specific property. Inspired by
xisting, but not fully understood, relationship of a soft and
mic lattice on the ionic conductivity, we aim to provide
nce on how changing the polarizability of the anion
ttice in one structure affects the ionic transport. In this
, we employ the argyrodite Li6PS5X as a model system in
h the halide content, and, hence, the polarizability of the
n framework, can be altered without major changes to the
ture or the Li [+] diffusion pathways. By combining structural
acterization with speed of sound measurements to obtain
mation about the materials softness and electrochemical
dance spectroscopy, we show that the lattice softness has a
g influence on the ionic transport. The presented work
oborates that a softer lattice lowers the activation barrier for
mp. However, a softer lattice also decreases the attempt



frequency of the jump and the entropy of migration, precisely
because of a reduction of the average vibrational frequencies of
the lattice. The simultaneous decrease in the attempt frequency,
entropy of migration, and activation barrier have contradicting
influences on the ionic conductivity. This work is a stepping
stone to gain a better understanding of the influence of a
dynamic lattice on ionic transport. It highlights the importance
of tailoring the lattice stiffness and suggests a necessary
paradigm shift regarding the knowledge that a soft lattice is not
necessarily always better for a solid ionic conductor.


2. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS


Synthesis. All preparations and sample treatments for Li6PS5X (X
= Cl, Cl0.25Br0.75, Cl0.5Br0.5, Cl0.75Br0.25, Br, Br0.75I0.25, Br0.5I0.5, Br0.25I0.75,
and I) were carried out under argon atmosphere. Lithium sulfide (Li2S,
Sigma-Aldrich, 99.98%), phosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5, SigmaAldrich, 99%), as well as LiCl (ChemPur, 99.99%), LiBr (ChemPur,
99.995%), and LiI (Alpha Aesar, 99.995%) were mixed in the
appropriate stoichiometric ratio. All mixtures were hand ground in an
agate mortar, pressed into pellets, and then filled into quartz ampules
(10 mm inner diameter and 10−12 cm in length), which were sealed
under vacuum. All ampules were carbon-coated and preheated at 800
°C under dynamic vacuum to avoid all traces of water in the reaction
atmosphere. The reactions were performed at 550 °C for 2 weeks in
order to ensure a complete reaction and phase purity. The obtained
mixture was subsequently ground and isostatically pressed into pellets
(10 mm diameter) for the electrochemical and speed of sound
measurements or kept as a powder for the diffraction studies. In order
to obtain standard deviations on each data set, reflecting changes in
microstructure and small compositional changes, each composition
was synthesized multiple times. Three syntheses per composition were
used for each of the speed of sound, impedance spectroscopy, and
neutron diffraction measurements.
Neutron Powder Diffraction. High-resolution neutron powder
diffraction data collection on the argyrodite samples was performed in
a Debye−Scherrer geometry at the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum
(research reactor FRM II, Garching b. München, Germany) on the
high-resolution diffractometer SPODI. [42] Data collection using one
wavelength was performed, i.e., monochromatic neutrons [λ =
1.548 17(2) Å], and were obtained from the thermal neutron beam
at a 155° takeoff angle using the 551 and 331 reflections of a vertically
focused composite Ge monochromator of 200 mm height. The vertical
position-sensitive multidetector (300 mm vertical sensitivity range at
1.117 m sample-to-detector distance) consisting of 80 [3] He tubes and
covering an angular range of 160° 2θ was used for data collection. The
samples (approximately 2 cm [3] in volume) were filled into a thin-walled
(0.15 mm) vanadium can 12 mm in diameter under argon atmosphere
and then metal-sealed using indium wire. The vanadium container was
then mounted on a capillary spinner enabling sample rotation, thus
minimizing the effects of preferred crystallite orientations. Twodimensional powder diffraction data of the continuously rotated
sample were collected and corrected for geometrical aberrations and
detector nonlinearities. [43]

Rietveld Analysis. Rietveld refinements were carried out using
GSAS II software. [44] The peak profile shape was described by a pseudoVoigt function using the modified Thomson−Cox−Hastings setting.
The instrumental resolution was determined using Na2Ca3Al2F14 as
the reference material. Fit indicatorsRwp, Rexp, and χ [2] were used to
assess the quality of the refined structural models. [45] The following
parameters were initially refined: (1) scale factor, (2) background
coefficients using a Chebyschev function with 10 free parameters, (3)
peak shape, which was modeled using a modified Thomson−Cox−
Hastings pseudo-Voigt function, [46] (4) lattice constants, (5) fractional
atomic coordinates, (6) isotropic atomic displacement parameters, and
(7) zero-shift error. Finally, (8) atomic occupancies of the anions were
then allowed to refine simultaneously with all other parameters, to
quantify the anion site disorder.

. The intercage jumps are suggested to dominate long-range transport, and site disorder between the 4a and 4c sites is known to affect the
uctivity significantly. [64]



nchrotron Pair Distribution Function Analysis. Mark-tubes
of borosilicate glass (Hilgenberg) with an outer diameter of 0.9
were filled in an argon glovebox and flame-sealed. X-ray scattering
uitable for pair distribution function and diffraction analysis were
rmed at room temperature using the I15 instrument at the
ond Light Source (UK) beamline. High-energy X-rays (λ =
369 Å, 71.52 keV, bent Laue monochromator) were used in
ination with a PerkinElmer 1621 EN area detector.
e crystallographic data, obtained from the refinements of the
data, were used as starting values for the analysis of the PDF
of Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Cl0.5Br0.5, Br, Br0.5I0.5, and I). The pair
bution function [G(r)] was employed for a more accurate
ural analysis, and the PDFgetX2 software was used to extract
from the raw diffraction data. [47] The collected data were first
cted for background, sample absorption, and Compton scattering.
, normalized structure functions [S(Q)] were obtained. Finally,
was Fourier-transformed to yield G(r). A maximum scattering
r (Qmax) of 17 Å [−][1] was employed in the Fourier transform.
tural refinements were carried out using the PDFgui software. [48]

ocal crystal structure of the Li6PS5X crystallites was refined in the
space group. The fit of this structural model to the experimental
data was performed in the 1.8−30 Å interatomic distance range.
following parameters were refined: (1) scale factor, (2) lattice
meters (a), (3) local correlated motion factor, (4) fractional
c coordinates of the sulfur atoms, and (5) atomic isotropic
acement parameters. Fractional atomic coordinates for the lithium
s were fixed to values determined from the refinement of neutron
ction data, and atomic displacement parameters for the lithium
s were fixed to Uiso = 0.05. The Rw indicator was employed to
the quality of the refined structural models. [49]

ectrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. Electrical conducs were measured by ac impedance spectroscopy, using a customsetup. Powder samples were placed between two stainless steel
with 10 mm diameter and pressed at 3 tons for 3 min.
rochemical impedance analysis (EIS) was conducted in the
erature range from −10 to 60 °C using a SP300 impedance
zer (Biologic) at frequencies from 7 MHz to 100 mHz with an
tude of 10 mV. For the samples analyzed here, all compositions
been synthesized and characterized three times in order to obtain
ard deviations and reflect changes in composition and microure. All values shown reflect the average values and the
sponding standard deviations.
trasonic Speed of Sound Measurements. Pulse-echo speed
und measurements were performed on consolidated disks using
och 600 (Olympus) with 5 MHz transducers for longitudinal and
verse speeds of sound. Since the samples are highly air sensitive
enclosing the pellets in pouches would prevent penetration of
verse signals, the samples were coated with a thin layer (&lt;200
of gold in order to prevent side reactions of the couplant and the



sample. All measurements were performed under a nitrogen
atmosphere. The measurement uncertainty from the speed of sound
data results stems from the uncertainty in the thickness and the
porosity. As the measurement uncertainty for the thickness of the
pellet is much higher than that of the gold layer, the thin layer of Au is
not expected to add significantly to the measurement uncertainty. In
addition, no damping of the signal is expected due to the high
crystallinity and high speed of sound in Au. This measurement
procedure has recently been shown to be successful in understanding
the lattice softness of Li10GeP2S12. [50] While in typical sound
measurements on 100% dense samples an uncertainty of 2% can be
achieved, here each sample composition has been synthesized and
measured three times in order to obtain standard deviations on these
85% dense samples. All values shown reflect the average values with
the corresponding standard deviations.
Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) measurements were
performed on an additional set of samples (two samples of each
composition) using a commercial RUSpec system built by Quasar
International. [51][,][52] Measurements were carried out in an argon-filled
glovebox to avoid sample decomposition. In contrast to the pulse-echo
method, RUS measurements do not require a couplant fluid for signal
transmission, so no Au film was required. A drive transducer sweeps
across a frequency range of 30−350 kHz, and two pickup transducers
record peaks whenever a resonant frequency of the sample is reached.
The elastic tensor elements C11, C12, and C44 were determined from
the RUS spectra using commercial software (RPModel, Quasar
International). For each scan, the overall goodness-of-fit, as
characterized by the root-mean-square (rms) difference between the
predicted and observed resonant frequencies, was less than 0.5%. The
speeds of sound were calculated from the elastic constants using

_v_ trans = _C_ 44/ _d_ and _v_ long = ( _C_ 11 + 2 _C_ 12 + 4 _C_ 44)/(3 ) _d_, where d is
the geometrically determined density of the samples. [53]

Ultrasonic measurements are a widely used and extremely accurate
approach to determine the elastic properties and speed of sound in
materials. [52][,][53] Such methods are a direct probe of the strength of the
bonds themselves. [54][−][57] Further, the obtained longitudinal and
transverse speeds of sound (vlong and vtrans) can be used to calculate
the mean speed of sound (vmean), as well as the Debye temperature
(ΘD) and Debye frequency (υD) via eqs 2−4. [58][−][60]

The substitution of X in Li6PS5X only changes the polarizability
and lattice parameter of the anion sublattice, without
significantly changing the conduction pathways or altering the
charge carrier concentration, thereby making the Li [+] superionic
argyrodites an ideal model system. This class of materials has
been well-studied in efforts to elucidate Li [+] conducting phases
and their conduction mechanisms, for instance by Deiseroth et

lattice dynamics effects. It should also be noted that the Ag and
Cu superionic compounds exist as well. Figure 1a shows the

in the PDF, an additional distance arises around 3.4 Å that
not correspond to any local distances in the structure of
S5X and seems to be decreasing from Cl to I (see the

[orting Information). For instance, in Li6PS5Br, the local](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b06327/suppl_file/ja7b06327_si_001.pdf)

s follows Vegard’s law, indicating the successful synthesis
solid solutions in Li6PS5X (Figure 3a). Due to the timespace-averaging character of the Bragg data, the lattice
meters, as obtained from PDF and neutron Bragg
ering data, deviate slightly. With the strong negative
ear scattering form factor of Li, lithium occupancies on the
sites (i.e., 48h and 24g) are also obtained from the
ements (see Figure 3b). At high Cl content, no Li can be
ified on the 24g position (the central position of the
gular site shown in Figure 1b). In other words, a 50%



occupancy on the 48h site suggests that every next-neighbor Li
site in the cage is unoccupied on average. With increasing Br
and I substitution, the Li occupancy of the 48h site decreases,
while it increases on the 24g one. The occupancy on the 24g
site can be explained structurally. Figure 3d shows the surface
area of the triangle sites for the jump from 48h to 24g to 48h, in
which the 24g position represents the transition state on the
triangular site. With increasing lattice volume, the distance
between Li and S (on Wyckoff 16e and 4c, respectively)
increases, which stabilizes the occupation of the transition state.
Figure 4 shows the changing Li [+] −Li [+] jump distances. With
increasing unit cell volume, the intra- and intercage jump
distances increase, while the 48h−48h separation decreases.

unit cell volume, the intra- and intercage jump distances increase, while
the doublet distance decreases, possibly due to being a measure of the
Li [+] disorder.


Figure 3c shows the obtained site disorder between X and S
on Wyckoff position 4c in which the percentage of shown
disorder represents the total fraction of all X [−] on the S [2][−] site.
The individual occupancies of Cl, Br, and I can be found in the
[Supporting Information. The X-ray PDF data for Cl](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b06327/suppl_file/ja7b06327_si_001.pdf) [−]   containing samples were not refined for disorder, as Cl [−] and
S [2][−] are indistinguishable via X-ray diffraction. In accordance
with the literature, [63] significant site disorder between Cl [−], as
well as Br [−] and S [2][−], is observed. With increasing lattice volume,
and an increasing difference in the ionic radius variation of the
anions, the site disorder decreases. No disorder is observable
for Li6PS5I, as the ionic radii of I [−] and S [2][−] are too different.
The change from Cl to Br and then to I leads to a clear
change in the volume of the lattice, as well as the site disorder.
The diminishing disorder is expected to increase the activation
barrier of the observable transport. [64] In addition, these data
show that with increasing lattice size, the probability of finding
Li [+] on the transition state site 24g increases, which may
ultimately affect the ionic transport, given that the lifetime of
the excited transition state is clearly increasing. While changes
in the structure are clearly visible, these effects are not expected
to have a major influence on the diffusion pathways per se, as
they do not alter the routes of Li diffusion in the structure.

measurements have been used previously to obtain elastic
constants of lithium conducting thiophosphates [73][−][75] and, just
recently, the Debye temperature of Li10GeP2S12. [50] Baranowski
et al. [73] found that speed of sound measurements (which are
generally considered to be more accurate than indentation) [51][−][53] correlate well with indentation experiments, if the
density of the samples is considered.

Figure 6 shows the obtained speeds of sound (longitudinal,
transverse, and mean speeds), the linear-fit extracted activation
barriers, the Arrhenius prefactors, and the room-temperature
ionic conductivities for all compositions of Li6PS5X. In order to
account for variations in the microstructure, density, and
syntheses, three different samples were synthesized and
measured for each composition. Despite increasing the lattice
volume and anion polarizability, the speeds of sound decrease
(Figure 6a), corresponding to an increase in the softness of the
lattice and, with it, decreasing Debye temperatures and Debye
frequencies of the solids (vide infra). Although slightly higher
speeds of sound would be expected for fully dense samples, [73]

the qualitative trend reflects the softening of the lattice when
substituting Cl for Br and I.
The linear-fit extracted EA and prefactors σ0 for the different
materials can be found in Figure 6b. It is evident that the
substitution of heavier halide anions leads to a decrease in the
activation barrier and a decrease in the prefactor σ0, as expected
within the Meyer−Neldel rule, [76][−][80] with the exception of the
iodine-containing Li6PS5X. Here, the absence of site disorder
leads to an increasing activation barrier, as expected from
theoretical considerations. [64] The decrease of the activation
barrier and the prefactor σ0 correlates well with the increasing
softness of the lattice (Figure 6a). The concurrent decrease of
both variables in eq 5, i.e., the Arrhenius prefactor σ0 and the
activation barrier EA, leads to an optimum of the ionic
conductivity at a composition of Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5. These data
demonstrate an experimental correlation between the softness
of a lattice and the activation barrier in ionic conductors.
However, with decreasing lattice softness, the Arrhenius
prefactor is strongly influenced, which in turn detrimentally
affects the ionic conductivity.


4. DISCUSSION

The collected data provide evidence that a correlation indeed
exists between a softer lattice and the ionic transport. With

boundary contributions do not significantly affect the

trasonic determination of the stiffness of a material can be
rmed by (1) directly measuring the speed of sound using a
-echo method or (2) measuring the resonant vibrational
uencies of the sample (resonant ultrasound spectroscopy,
). [51][−][53] In both cases, for a sample of known density and
nsions, the elastic constants and the transverse and
tudinal sound velocities can be determined with a high
ee of accuracy. In the present study, both methods were
to independently confirm the trend in the velocity as a
ion of composition. In addition to providing information

governed by a factor to take into account different diffusion
geometries and correlation factors (z), the carrier density of
mobile ions (n), the entropy of migration (ΔSm), the jump
distance (a0), the charge of the ions (Ze), and the attempt
frequency (ν0). The attempt frequency corresponds to the
oscillator frequency of a moving cation on its lattice site and
can, in terms of a transition state theory, be described as the
inverse of the lifetime of the excited ion state. [32] The frequency
of the occurring jump (jump frequency) then is a product of
the probability of the occurring jump and the attempt
frequency. [71] The migration enthalpy is related to that soft
vibrational mode that carries the ion across the saddle point [83][,][84]

and, hence, the attempt frequency. The entropy of migration
itself also depends on the phonon properties, as it is directly
related to the ratio of the vibrational partition functions of the
excited and the initial state. [83][,][85] In other words, both the
migrational entropy as well as the enthalpy, i.e., the activation
energy, are directly affected by the lattice vibrations. In this
work, changing the anion isoelectronically does not change the
number of charge carriers nor the diffusion pathways or the
defect formation enthalpies. The increasing anion size increases
the jump distance (see Figure 4) and the increasing
polarizability induces a softening of the lattice (Figure 6a).
This leads to lower speeds of sound, lower Debye temperatures,
and lower Debye frequencies (see eqs 3 and 4). The Debye
frequencies (νD), as obtained from the mean speeds of sound,
for the different compositions are shown in Figure 7a and
decrease as the lattice becomes softer. Since the attempt
frequency (ν0) is usually approximated using the Debye
frequency (νD), [86][,][87] a softening of the lattice should lead to a
decrease in the prefactor. Using the formalism of transition
state theory of ionic motion, the oscillator frequency can be
estimated from the activation barrier via [32]

Figure 7b shows the jump frequency (ν0) versus the Debye
frequency (νD) of the different compositions, calculated via eq
7 from the measured activation barriers, as well as the jump
distance of the intercage jump (Figure 4). A direct correlation
can be seen, within the estimated errors obtained by
propagation of the standard deviations, in that the activation
barriers are influenced by a softening of the lattice. The
influence of the lattice vibrations on the prefactor and the
activation barrier may indeed be one explanation for the origin
of the Meyer−Neldel rule (or compensation rule), [76][−][80] which
states that a decreasing activation barrier often coincides with a
lower prefactor. It should be noted, however, that the Debye
frequencies as obtained from pulse-echo measurements are an
order of magnitude smaller than the obtained frequencies.
Some of the deviation may be due to the lower density of the
samples [73] or the used intracage jump distances, which may not

changing vibrational frequencies of the lattice affects the
opy of migration more strongly through the ratio of the
nic partition functions. Furthermore, while the site
der in the I-containing material leads to an increase in
ctivation barrier, the prefactor continues to decrease (see
[upporting Information, Figure S2). This shows that while](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.7b06327/suppl_file/ja7b06327_si_001.pdf)



local structural changes affect the activation energy as well, the
entropy of migration is only dependent on the lattice vibrations.
The lattice softening leads to a lower Debye frequency,
which lowers the jump frequency, and the entropy of migration.
All of these decrease the Arrhenius prefactor as well the
activation barrier for the ion jump (Figure 8). Interestingly, the
decreasing jump frequency should lead to an increased lifetime
(τ0) of the excited state (ν0 = 1/τ0), [32] and indeed, the
occupancy of the 24g position increases along the solid
solutions series (see Figure 3b). Whether the increasing
population of the 24g position, and increasing lifetime of this
transition site, derives from a larger lattice (i.e., more space for
occupation) or whether it is due to a softer lattice remains
unclear at this stage.
The observed correlation between a softer lattice and the
oscillator frequency of a moving ion shows that a softer lattice
indeed lowers the activation barrier, as assumed in the past, but
also affects the Arrhenius prefactor, leading to an optimum
lattice softness for Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5 and a rapid decrease in the
conductivity for lattices that are too soft. In addition, these data
experimentally confirm the theoretical proposition [64] that a
decreasing site disorder increases the activation barrier for a
jump, which explains the low conductivities in the iodinecontaining argyrodites when taking the Arrhenius prefactor into
consideration.


5. CONCLUSION

In this work, the effect of lattice polarizability on the ionic
conductivity has been studied in the Li6PS5X argyrodites. Using
a combination of neutron diffraction and synchrotron pairdistribution function analysis, lattice variations and, more
specifically, the Li [+] occupancies and X [−] /S [2][−] site disorder were
monitored. In addition, speeds of sound measurements were
used to obtain information about changes in the lattice softness,
upon substituting the anion sublattice from rigid Cl [−] to the
more polarizable I [−] .
Impedance spectroscopy showed that changing the lattice
dynamics (in this case by softening the lattice) affects ionic
motion within solids. A softer lattice lowers the migration
barrier for a moving cation, as previously proposed, but this
work further demonstrates that the softer lattice affects both the
oscillator frequency of a moving ion and the Arrhenius
prefactor as well. This suggests that the commonly accepted
paradigm of “a softer lattice for higher conductivities” may not

ABSTRACT: Solid-state batteries with inorganic solid electrolytes are
currently being discussed as a more reliable and safer future alternative to
the current lithium-ion battery technology. To compete with state-of-the-
art lithium-ion batteries, solid electrolytes with higher ionic conductivities
are needed, especially if thick electrode conﬁgurations are to be used. In the
search for optimized ionic conductors, the lithium argyrodites have
attracted a lot of interest. Here, we systematically explore the inﬂuence of
aliovalent substitution in Li6+xP1−xGexS5I using a combination of X-ray and
neutron diﬀraction, as well as impedance spectroscopy and nuclear
magnetic resonance. With increasing Ge content, an anion site disorder is
induced and the activation barrier for ionic motion drops signiﬁcantly,
leading to the fastest lithium argyrodite so far with 5.4 ± 0.8 mS cm−1 in a
cold-pressed state and 18.4 ± 2.7 mS cm−1 upon sintering. These high
ionic conductivities allow for successful implementation within a thick-electrode solid-state battery that shows negligible
capacity fade over 150 cycles. The observed changes in the activation barrier and changing site disorder provide an additional
approach toward designing better performing solid electrolytes.
1. INTRODUCTION
Solid-state batteries provide a possibility for energy storage with
higher energy densities and improved safety by using a solid
electrolyte and lithium metal anode, as compared to using liquid
electrolytes.1−7 There have been many recent advances in the
ﬁeld concerning a better understanding of the interfacial
reactions,8−10 the employment of coatings,11,12 the minimized
use of carbon additives,13−15 strain design and particle size
optimization in the electrodes.16−18 However, the challenge for
thick electrode conﬁgurations19 still remains: the use of solid
electrolytes in thick electrode conﬁgurations is currently limited
by the low ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes.2,19 Electro-
lytes with high ionic conductivities are needed to achieve higher
energy densities.
Recently, among all of the well-performing lithium
thiophosphates, such as the Li2S−P2S5 glass phases and
Li10MP2S12 (M = Ge, Sn),20−29 the class of argyrodites
Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) has attracted considerable interest.30−34
The crystal structure of Li6PS5X is shown in Figure 1. In a fully
ordered arrangement, the halide anions X−form a face-centered
cubic lattice (Wyckoﬀ4a) with PS4
3−tetrahedra on the
octahedral sites (P on Wyckoﬀ4b) and the free S2−in half of
the tetrahedral sites (Wyckoﬀ4d). Diﬀusion in solid electrolytes
is usually analyzed in terms of jumps between individual sites.35
Crystallographic studies in the argyrodites have identiﬁed two
distinct Li+ positions, namely, the 48h and 24g Wyckoﬀ
positions, which form Li+ cages around the free S2−on Wyckoﬀ
4d. Within a site-jump model of lithium diﬀusion there are three
inequivalent jumps: 48h−24g−48h (doublet jump), 48h−48h
within the cage (intracage jump), and 48h−48h between the
cages (intercage jump).30,33 For X = Cl and Br the S2−and X−
positions exhibit a signiﬁcant fraction of anion site disor-
der.32−34,36 If iodine is the halide in the structure, no site
disorder occurs due to the large size mismatch between S2−and
I−,30 opening up the question as to whether the site disorder can
be inﬂuenced further. Kraft et al. have recently shown that the
absence of the disorder in the iodine-containing argyrodites is
associated with high activation barriers for ion migration and a
low ionic conductivity of 1.3 × 10−6 S cm−1.30 While

substitutions have been performed mostly on the anion sites in
the argyrodites, a recent study shows the possibility of aliovalent
doping in Li6+xP1−xSixS5Br,31 producing an increase in the ionic
conductivity. It should be noted however that the incorporation
of Ge4+ in Li6PS5Br was not possible due to the larger ionic
radius of Ge4+ in the smaller lattice volume in Li6PS5Br.
Inspired by the possibility of incorporating Ge into a
composition possessing a larger unit cell, we have investigated
the eﬀect of Ge4+ substitution in Li6+xP1−xGexS5I on the
structure-transport relationships. Using a combination of
Rietveld reﬁnements against neutron and X-ray diﬀraction
data, we identify the underlying structural changes associated
with the Li and anion substructures including changes to the site
disorder. Impedance spectroscopy and lithium nuclear magnetic
resonance were used to monitor the changing ionic transport.
With increasing Ge fraction, the diﬀusion pathways for Li+
expand and site disorder between the S2−and I−positions
appears. The increasing disorder is correlated to a sharp decrease
in the activation barrier and an increase in the conductivity over
orders of magnitude, leading to the highest in lithium reported
so far with σ = 5.4 ± 0.8 mS cm−1, when cold-pressed, and σ =
18.4 ± 2.7 mS cm−1 upon sintering. We further show that this
fast ionic conductor can be used to build solid-state batteries
with thick anode and cathode layers, exhibiting stable capacities
for at least 150 cycles, even at higher C-rates. This work
demonstrates that inducing disorder in materials using
elemental substitutions is a promising approach to alter the
potential energy landscape tailoring the ionic conductivity of
solid electrolytes for better performing all-solid-state batteries.
2. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
Synthesis. All preparations and sample treatments for
Li6+xP1−xGexS5I were carried out under an argon atmosphere. Lithium
sulﬁde (Li2S, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.98%), phosphorus pentasulﬁde (P2S5,
Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), germanium sulﬁde (GeS, Alpha Aesar, 99.99%),
sulfur (S, Acros Organics, 99.999%), and LiI (Alpha Aesar, 99.995%)
were mixed in the appropriate stoichiometric ratio. Before the synthesis,
all precursors were thoroughly dried and sulfur was sublimated. All
mixtures were hand ground in an agate mortar, pressed into pellets, and
then ﬁlled into quartz ampules (10 mm inner diameter and 10−12 cm
in length), which were sealed under vacuum. All ampules were carbon-
coated and preheated at 800 °C under dynamic vacuum to avoid all
traces of water in the reaction atmosphere The reactions were
The obtained mixture was subsequently ground and isostatically
pressed into pellets (10 mm diameter) for the impedance measure-
ments or kept as powder for the diﬀraction studies.
Neutron Powder Diﬀraction. High-resolution neutron powder
diﬀraction data collection on the argyrodite samples Li6+xP1−xGexS5I
with x = 0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.3, and 0.6 was performed in a Debye−Scherrer
geometry at the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (research reactor FRM
II, Garching b. München, Germany) on the high-resolution
diﬀractometer SPODI.37 Data collection was performed using one
wavelength, i.e., monochromatic neutrons (λ = 1.548 17(2) Å) that
were obtained from the thermal neutron beam at a 155° takeoﬀangle
using the 551 and 331 reﬂections of a vertically focused composite Ge
monochromator of 200 mm height. The vertical-position-sensitive
multidetector (300 mm vertical sensitivity range at 1.117 m sample-to-
detector distance) consisting of 80 3He tubes and covering an angular
range of 160° 2θ was used for data collection. The samples
(approximately 2 cm3 in volume) were ﬁlled into a thin-wall (0.15
mm) vanadium can of 12 mm in diameter under an argon atmosphere
and then metal-sealed using indium wire. The vanadium container was
then mounted on a capillary spinner enabling sample rotation and, thus,
minimizing eﬀects of preferred crystallite orientations. Two-dimen-
sional powder diﬀraction data of the continuously rotated sample were
collected and corrected for geometrical aberrations and detector
nonlinearities.38
X-ray Powder Diﬀraction. X-ray diﬀraction measurements of
Li6+xP1−xGexS5I were carried out on a PANalytical Empyrean powder
diﬀractometer in Bragg−Brentano θ−θ geometry with Cu Kα radiation.
Measurements were carried out in the 2θ range between 10° and 90°
with a step size of 0.026°. The counting time per step was 300 s. All
powders were placed on (911)-oriented silicon zero background
holders and sealed using a 7.5 μm thick Kapton polyimide ﬁlm.
Rietveld Analysis. Rietveld reﬁnements were carried out using the
TOPAS-Academic V6 software package.39 Similar to recent work on
Li10GeP2S12,25 a 2θ range of 10−26.5° was excluded from the
reﬁnements of X-ray diﬀractions in order to mitigate the interfering
diﬀraction intensity from the polyimide ﬁlm background. The resultant
structural data obtained with excluding the lower 2θ range are in good
agreement with those from the neutron diﬀraction data over the whole
measured 2θ range. The peak proﬁle shape was described by a pseudo-
Voigt function using the modiﬁed Thomson−Cox−Hastings setting.40
Fit indicators Rwp and Rexp and the goodness-of-ﬁt S were used to assess
the quality of the reﬁned structural models.41 The following parameters
were initially reﬁned: (1) scale factor, (2) 30 coeﬃcients for a
Chebyshev background, (3) peak shape, (4) lattice parameters
including sample displacement, (5) fractional atomic coordinates, (6)
isotropic atomic displacement parameters. Finally (7), atomic
occupancies of the anions were then allowed to reﬁne simultaneously
with all other parameters, to quantify the anion site disorder.
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. Electrical conduc-
tivities were measured by ac impedance spectroscopy, using pellets with
vapor-deposited gold layers. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) was conducted in the temperature range of −20 to 60 °C using a
VMP300 impedance analyzer (Bio-Logic Science Instruments) at
frequencies from 7 MHz to 100 mHz with an amplitude of 10 mV. All
ﬁts were performed using the RelaxIS software package (rhd
Instruments, version 3).
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. Variable-temperature T1 and
quadrupolar echo experiments have been performed on a Bruker NMR
spectrometer operating at a lithium (7Li) frequency of 77.8 MHz. All
experiments were performed in the static mode. Quadrupolar echo
experiments were acquired to estimate temperature-induced line
narrowing, which reports on the dynamics in kHz frequency range.
The pulse sequence consisted of two 90° pulses separated by a 30 μs
echo delay; after the second 30 μs echo delay acquisition started. Sixty-
four scans have been collected to obtain a spectrum at each
temperature, and a recycle delay of 5 s was found to be suﬃcient to
obtain full restoration of the initial spin state before each repetition.
Full-width at half-height (fwhh) has been used as a measure of motional
averaging of the “rigid” line width For T relaxation time measure
Figure 1. (a) Crystal structure of Li6PS5X (X = I), in which the I−form a
face-centered cubic lattice, with PS4 tetrahedra in the octahedral voids
and a free S2−on half of the tetrahedral vacant sites (4d). The Li+ forms
pseudo-octahedral cages around the S2−site with two crystallo-
graphically distinct positions, 24g and 48h. (b) For lithium transport
eﬀected by discrete jumps between sites, the rate-determining step is
the intercage 48h−48h jump, as shown by the LiS3I polyhedra. This
requires lithium to move past a window of the 4a iodine site and the
sulfur of the PS4 tetrahedra.

--------------------------------------------------
ments a saturation−recovery pulse sequence has been used. Relaxation
delays have been varied from 1 ms up to 10 s, and 16 transitions have
been accumulated to gain each point of the relaxation buildup curve.
After acquisition, a single-exponential function has been ﬁtted to the
experimental relaxation data to get a characteristic relaxation time T1.
Cell Assembly. All-solid-state battery cells using the
Li P Ge S I electrolyte in combination with a LiNi Co Mn O
(NCM-622) cathode and a Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) anode (both provided by
BASF SE) were assembled inside of a hot-press setup under an argon
atmosphere. The diameter of the cell was 12 mm. Details on the setup
are provided in a previous publication.42 Prior to use, the active
materials were dried in a vacuum Büchi oven at 250 °C overnight. The
cathode composite was prepared in an agate mortar consisting of NCM-
622 and SE in a mass ratio of 70:30 A total of 55 mg of the cathode

of impurity phases can be found that correspond to ∼1.6 wt % LiI in the X-ray diﬀraction data and ∼3.4 wt % LiI in the neutron diﬀraction data, along
with reﬂections of the V sample holder. Rwp and S are weighted proﬁle R-factor and goodness of ﬁt, respectively.

cm 2 and a thickness of approximately 160 μm. A mass of 150 mg of
solid electrolyte served as a separator (thickness ∼450 μm). The anode
composite consisted of LTO and SE in a mass ratio of 50:50. A mass of
91 mg of the anode composite was employed (capacity = 7.04 mAh
cm−2), resulting in an anode thickness of 340 μm. The layered powders
were compressed at 30 kN (∼2650 bar) and heated to 60 °C. The
conditions were maintained during electrochemical experiments.
The battery cycling and EIS on the complete cell were carried out
using an SP-150 potentiostat/galvanostat (Bio-Logic Science Instru-
ments). The galvanostatic cycling was performed at a C-rate of 0.25 C
(1.71 mA cm−2), C-rate of 0.5 C (3.42 mA cm−2), and C-rate of 1 C
(6.84 mA cm−2) in a voltage range of 1.10−2.75 V vs Li4Ti5O12/
Li7Ti5O12, corresponding to approximately 2.65−4.30 V vs Li+/Li. The
current density was calculated based on a theoretical capacity of 200
mAh g−1 of the cathode active material. After electrochemical relaxation
of 30 min, EIS measurements were conducted with an amplitude of 20
mV in a frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz.
Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray
Analysis. Cross-sectional images of the battery stack after disassembly
were obtained on a Merlin high-resolution scanning electron
microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany). The samples were transferred
from a glovebox in the analysis chamber under an argon atmosphere
using a transfer vessel (Leica EM VC500). EDX analysis was conducted
using an XMAX EXTREME EDX detector (Oxford Instruments,
United Kingdom). Measurements were carried out by application of an
acceleration voltage of 5 kV and a probing current of 1000 pA.
3. RESULTS
Structural Characterization. The Li+ superionic argyr-
odites Li6+xP1−xGexS5I have been synthesized with increasing
Ge4+/P5+ ratios in order to study the structural changes and
assess the eﬀect of the increasing lithium content on the ionic
conductivity. For the structural characterization, X-ray dif-
fraction was performed on all samples. Moreover, due to the low
X-ray form factor of Li+, selected samples of x = 0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.3,
and 0.6 were also investigated using neutron diﬀraction to better
probe the changing Li+ substructure. These sample composi-
tions were selected based on the occurring changes in the ionic
transport (vide infra).
Figure 2 shows a representative Rietveld reﬁnement of an X-
ray and a neutron diﬀraction pattern for the compound with the
nominal composition Li6.6P0.4Ge0.6S5I. All samples exhibit minor
impurity phase fractions of LiI and/or Li4GeS4 in the diﬀraction
data for the series of solid solutions (see Tables S1−S16 in
Supporting Information). The minor impurities are unlikely to
aﬀect the ionic transport,30,31 and the obtained structural data of
all solid solutions, obtained via Rietveld reﬁnement against
laboratory X-ray and neutron diﬀraction patterns, can also be
found tabulated in the Supporting Information. Recently, we
have shown that the Si4+ substitution was possible in
Li6+xP1−xSixS5Br up to 30 at. %, whereas the incorporation of
Ge4+ was unsuccessful.31 Here in Li6+xP1−xGexS5I, the reﬁned
lattice parameters show an increasing unit cell volume up to 80
at. % Ge, corresponding to the formation of a solid solution
(Figure 3a). However, the samples of x = 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0 exhibit
high fractions of the impurity phase Li4GeS4 (see Supporting
Information Figure S1), indicating that a solubility limit has
been reached. A Rietveld reﬁnement of the occupancies of Ge on
Wyckoﬀ4b shows an increasing occupancy of Ge up to 70 at. %
(Figure 3b). At higher nominal Ge contents, xN, the Ge
occupancy remains constant and only the amount of the
impurity phase Li4GeS4 increases. The reﬁnement of the Ge
occupancy in the x = 0.9 sample is not possible due to the large
amount of overlapping impurity reﬂections
The minor
(x = 0.8) and the Ge occupancy (x = 0.7) is likely due to the
larger uncertainty on the reﬁned occupancy coming from
overlapping reﬂections of the main phase with the Li4GeS4
impurity phase. While there seems to be a degree of uncertainty
on the exact solubility limit, full solid solutions of
Li6+xP1−xGexS5I can be synthesized up to a composition of at
least Li6.7P0.3Ge0.7S5I. Despite the solubility limit, the samples
with x = 0.8 are included in the following structural and
transport data, whenever applicable, to allow for a discussion
beyond the solubility limit in this material. In addition, in order
to allow for a better discussion of the data, all subsequent data
are shown against the reﬁned Ge fraction xR, as obtained from
the neutron and X-ray diﬀraction data, respectively.
With increasing Ge4+ occupancy on the (P/Ge)S4
3−
tetrahedra, the volumes of the tetrahedra increase due to the
larger ionic radius of Ge4+ vs P5+, i.e., 0.39 pm vs 0.19 pm,43 in
the tetrahedral coordination (Figure 3c). Another structural
characteristic within the argyrodite structure is the possible site
disorder between the free S2−anion located on Wyckoﬀ4d and
the halide anion I−on Wyckoﬀ4a. While Cl−- and Br−-
containing argyrodites show a high degree of anion site disorder,
in which the disorder decreases with increasing anionic size
mismatch, no disorder had been found for Li6PS5I due to the
large diﬀerence in ionic radii between I−and S2−.30 Figure 3d
shows the I−/S2−site disorder, as obtained from the Rietveld
reﬁnements against X-ray and neutron diﬀraction data. At a Ge
fraction of ∼20 at. % there is a clear onset of I−/S2−site disorder,
reaching ∼7% around the solubility limit. Whether the changing
disorder occurs due to a larger unit cell after Ge4+ substitution,
which allows for better mixing of the mismatched anions, or due
to the increasing Li+ density in the structure remains unclear.
Within the series of solid solutions Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I), a
decreasing site disorder due to the incorporation of I−is
correlated to an increase in the activation barrier for the
migrating Li+ cations,30 as measured by impedance spectrosco-
py, and similar eﬀects on the ionic transport may be expected
here.
In addition to the structural changes of the (Ge/P)S4
tetrahedra and I−/S2−site disorder, the neutron diﬀraction
data allow the analysis of the changes in the Li+ substructure
(Figure 4). With increasing Ge4+ occupancy, the Li+ occupancy
of the 24g site increases (Figure 4a), and essentially all additional
Li+ occupies this site, similar to the behavior observed for the
incorporation of Si4+ in Li6PS5Br.31 The increasing Li occupancy
on the 24g site leads to the larger Coulombic repulsion, which
results in the longer doublet distance 48h−24g−48h, whereas a
minor decrease of the distance between the Li cages (i.e., the
intercage distance) can be found. Furthermore, with increasing
Li+ and Ge4+ content in the structure the tetrahedral volume of
Li(48h)S3I polyhedra and the area of the Li(24g)S3 triangular
plane increase. As the Li(48h)S3I polyhedra represent the
bottleneck for the rate-determining intercage jump, the wider
diﬀusion pathways for Li+ in the structure may aﬀect the
mobility of the moving cation.
Ionic Transport. Temperature-dependent impedance spec-
troscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements were
performed to assess changes to the ionic conductivity. Arrhenius
plots of all samples of Li6+xP1−xGexS5I and their corresponding
impedance responses with the respective ﬁts are shown in Figure
5. The impedance data were ﬁt with an equivalent circuit
consisting of one parallel constant phase element (CPE)/
resistor in series with a CPE
representing the blocking

--------------------------------------------------
electrodes. In the samples with a high Ge fraction, the CPE/
resistor has shifted to frequencies that are too high to measure
with the impedance analyzer, and only the tail of the blocking
electrodes was used for the ﬁt. The resolvable impedance spectra
exhibit α-values of ∼0.9, representing the ideality of the CPE,44
and geometric capacitances around 16 to 47 pF cm−2. The
extracted values of the impedance analyses are tabulated in the
boundary contributions cannot be deconvoluted; however, the
obtained ideality of the semicircle and capacitances correspond
well with bulk transport,45 as typically observed for these Li+
conducting argyrodites.30,31
Figure 6 shows the ionic conductivities of Li6+xP1−xGexS5I, as
measured by impedance spectroscopy, as well as the extracted
activation barrier for Li+ migration. With increasing fraction of
Ge4+ and Li+, the conductivity increases over 3 orders of
magnitude and reaches a maximum conductivity of σ = 5.4 ± 0.8
mS cm−1 for Li6.6P0.4Ge0.6S5I. As the observed increase in the
conductivity cannot be directly explained by the minor increase
in charge carrier density, the activation energy must be having a
tremendous inﬂuence. With increasing x, the activation barrier
remains constant at ﬁrst and then signiﬁcantly drops, showing an
inﬂection around xR = 0.25 that is responsible for the high ionic
conductivity in the Ge-substituted Li6+xP1−xGexS5I. Sintering of
the cold pressed pellets at 823 K for 10 min increases the
conductivity further to σ = 18.4 ± 2.7 mS cm−1, likely due to
better grain contact. The variance in the conductivity is
calculated from multiple measurements conducted with diﬀer-
ent measurement setups to corroborate these high conductivity
values (see Supporting Information Figure S2).
In addition to the impedance data, selected sample
compositions were investigated using
7Li nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy. Figure 7a shows changes of the signal
line width as a function of temperature for three measured
samples with the compositions of x = 0.0, 0.25, and 0.6 in
Li6+xP1−xGexS5I, chosen for their diﬀerent activation barriers
(vide infra). Only Li6PS5I demonstrates signiﬁcant dependence
of the signal width, whereas the fwhh for all other samples
appears to be rather small, even at the lowest available
temperatures. Line narrowing starts when the mobility of nuclei
in frequency units matches the line width in the rigid limit (a
plateau at very low temperatures). Thus, one can estimate the
activation energy and the speed of the local ionic motion. As a
low-temperature plateau is only observed in the Li6PS5I sample,
the Hendrickson−Bray approach46 can be used to obtain
motional parameters in this composition. For the undoped
Li6PS5I this procedure gives an estimation of the activation
energy of 0.49 eV (Figure 7b). The frequency of the
corresponding motion can be extrapolated to room temperature
and is found to be 1 × 106 s−1. In contrast, samples with x = 0.25
and x = 0.6 undergo much faster motional processes, which
cannot be characterized with the current method. Therefore, T1
relaxation time studies (for more information see the of Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance section in the Supporting Information) are
employed to expand the sensitivity window of the dynamical
NMR to nanoseconds. The samples with x = 0 and x = 0.6 can be
accurately ﬁtted with a single symmetric curve around the
maximum, indicating equal Ea values at high and low
temperatures. However, the sample with x = 0.25 reveals
diﬀerent slopes for both ﬂanks, which can be attributed to the
coexistence of two types of motion. The ﬁrst one is activated at
lower temperatures and has an activation energy of Ea
LT = 0.11
eV, and another one appears at higher temperatures and is
characterized by Ea
HT = 0.21 eV. All T1-deﬁned dynamical
parameters and analysis procedures are listed in the Supporting
Information (Table S18).
Assuming that Li+ transport consists of hops between well-
deﬁned crystallographic sites, there are three diﬀerent jump
processes possible in Li6PS5X argyrodites, i.e., the doublet 48h
jumps the intracage and the intercage movements Moreover

an increase in the distance between the 48h−24g−48 positions
(doublet distance), which can be attributed to increased Coulombic
repulsion, and a decreasing jump distance between the Li+ cages
(intercage jump). (c) With increasing unit cell size and size of the
adjacent (P/Ge)S4 tetrahedra, the Li(48h)S3I polyhedra and Li(24g)S3
triangle areas are increasing, corresponding to wider diﬀusion pathways
for Li+.

--------------------------------------------------
while all jumps are necessary for the long-range transport of Li+
ions,33 intercage jumps have been proposed to be the rate-
determining step. Combining this knowledge with the results of
our dynamical NMR studies, one can describe the motional
picture in the Ge-doped samples. The undoped Li6PS5I
undergoes two diﬀerent motional changes in the μs−ns time
scale. We suppose that the faster (visible in T1 relaxation)
corresponds to the 48h−24g−48h (doublet jumps) or 48h−48h
(intracage jumps) and does not lead to long-range transfer of the
Li+ ions. In contrast, the slower mobility, which becomes
apparent in motional narrowing experiments, is characterized by
a much higher activation energy and will be the limiting step in
the observable bulk transport, i.e., the intercage jump. The
Einstein−Smoluchowski and Nernst−Einstein equations can be
used to estimate the conductivity of the sample.47,48 First, the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient (D) is deﬁned from the frequency of motion
(Kexchange) and the distance between Li sites dLi−Li as obtained
from the Rietveld reﬁnement of neutron diﬀraction data:

where N is the charge carrier density approximated by the
number of Li+ ions per unit cell, q is the charge of the charge
carriers, and T is the temperature. Based on these equations, a
conductivity of 2.6 × 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature can be
estimated for Li6PS5I, close to the ionic conductivity obtained
via impedance spectroscopy.
Although NMR on the sample Li6.25P0.75Ge0.25S5I also reveals
two separate processes, which are likewise described by diﬀerent
activation energies, both modes are visible only in T1-relaxation
measurements, suggesting much faster rates than those existing
in the undoped sample. We propose that the mode with an
activation energy of 0.11 eV corresponds to small ﬂuctuations
between 48h and 24g sites or the intracage jump process, and the
second process can be ascribed to intercage jumps. The sample
with a Ge content of 0.6 undergoes a single motional process in
the current time scale window with rather low activation energy,
in good agreement with the data from impedance spectroscopy

Figure 6. Activation barrier and ionic conductivity of Li6+xP1−xGexS5I as
a function of the reﬁned Ge content, as obtained from impedance
spectroscopy. With increasing Ge4+ and Li+ concentration, the ionic
conductivity increases over 3 orders of magnitude, reaching a
conductivity of σ = 5.4 mS cm−1. An inﬂection point starting at
∼20% Ge can be seen that leads to a strong decrease of the activation
barrier.

--------------------------------------------------
We suppose that this corresponds to intercage jumps, whereas
all smaller scale movements stay outside of the sensitivity
window of the method. Using eqs 1 and 2, a conductivity of 3.9
mS cm−1 can be estimated for x = 0.25 and 7.5 mS cm−1 for x =
0.6 in Li6+xP1−xGexS5I. Overall, the estimated Li-ion con-
ductivities obtained here are in good agreement with the
conductivities measured via impedance spectroscopy, suggest-
ing the reduction in the activation energy of the rate-limiting
intercage jumps is key to the high conductivity. The slight
discrepancy in the conductivity obtained by impedance
spectroscopy can likely be attributed to the changing correlation
factors with changing Li+ carrier density.49,51
Structure-Transport Correlation. The collected data on
the aliovalent substitution of Li6+xP1−xGexS5I show that simple
substitutions can have a tremendous inﬂuence on the ionic
transport in the argyrodite structure and that a high conductivity
in the solid electrolytes can be obtained. Impedance spectros-
copy and nuclear magnetic resonance data show a decrease in
the activation barrier for ionic motion with the inﬂection point
around x = 0 25 In addition the structural data obtained by
Rietveld reﬁnements against neutron and X-ray diﬀraction data
show an increasing width of the diﬀusion pathway and an
increase in the I−/S2−site disorder. In Figure 8a, the changing
activation barriers are shown together with the changing of I−/
S2−site disorder on Wyckoﬀ4a. There is a clear correlation
between the onset of the site disorder and the drop in the
activation barrier. As recently theoretically suggested33 and
experimentally corroborated,30 disorder between the free sulfur
site (Wyckoﬀ4d) and the halide site (Wyckoﬀ4a) leads to lower
activation barriers. In Li6PS5Br1−xIx, Kraft et al.30 were able to
show that a subsequent replacement of Br−with I−leads to fewer
halide anions on the free sulfur site and vice versa, resulting in an
increasing activation barrier for ionic motion. In this work, the
occurrence of disorder leads to a sharp decrease of the activation
barrier.
Despite the clear correlation between the disorder and the
decreasing activation barrier, it remains puzzling that such a
small degree of disorder can aﬀect the transport so signiﬁcantly.

--------------------------------------------------
disorder.52 However, Figure 8b shows that the Li+ ions surround
the S2−site, forming four clusters that are directly linked to the I−
site. Each cluster faces the I−site with three possible 48h
positions of Li+, and from each cluster six jumps are possible to
clusters adjacent to the same I−position. Each S2−on the I−site
(Wyckoﬀ4a) then opens up three low-energy intercage
pathways (see Figure 8c), and percolation would then be
expected at 4% for a random distribution. In other words, the
high multiplicity of the Li+ site seemingly makes percolation
possible, even at low degrees of disorder. This change in the local
environment of Li+ and the changing potential energy landscape
are schematically shown in Figure 8c.
The here-observed correlation between the site disorder and
the activation barrier shows that structural changes can have a
tremendous inﬂuence on the ionic transport in argyrodites. In
this example of Li6PS5X, tailoring the disorder in such materials
clearly helps to optimize solid electrolytes toward higher ionic
conductivities.
Solid-State Battery. Successful implementation of solid-
state batteries requires maximizing the energy densities, making
thick electrode conﬁgurations necessary.19 While the con-
ductivity of the sintered Li6.6P0.4Ge0.6S5I is the highest Li+
conductivity reported in the argyrodites so far, solid-state
batteries employing thiophosphates commonly use cold-pressed
electrolytes, so this high conductivity value for the sintered
sample will not be utilized in a practical all-solid-state battery
setup. Therefore, using the cold-pressed fast conducting
Li6.6P0.4Ge0.6S5I, solid-state cells were constructed with thick
cathode and anode composites. The cathode has an approximate
thickness of 160 μm and the anode, having a higher SE fraction,
is estimated to be 340 μm thick (Figure 9d). The separator
thickness is approximately 450 μm. At a charging rate of 0.25 C
and a temperature of 60 °C, the thick electrode cell oﬀers an
initial charging capacity of 120.8 mAh g−1. The initial discharge
capacity is 88.8 mAh g−1, which stabilizes to 99.3 mAh g−1 in the
subsequent cycles, indicating a beneﬁcial interphase formation
(Figure 9a and b).8−10 Without the addition of carbon additives
or protective interfacial modiﬁcations,14 the cell shows stable
cycling with little to no capacity fade over 50 cycles, maintaining
a very high Coulombic eﬃciency. The stability of the capacity is
even obtained when increasing the C-rate to 0.5 C and even
further to 1 C, upon cycling for 50 additional cycles at each rate.
Despite this thick electrode conﬁguration, the total resistance of
the cell is below 13 Ω cm−2 at 60 °C (see Supporting
Information Figure S3). The herein presented cell demonstrates
the feasibility of high and stable performances when employing a
superionic thiophosphate solid electrolyte with nondetrimental
interphase formation.
4. CONCLUSION
In this work, aliovalent substitution in Li6+xP1−xGexS5I was
performed, and the changes to the structure and transport were
investigated. Using a combination of X-ray and neutron
diﬀraction, nuclear magnetic resonance, and impedance spec-
troscopy, the lattice variations, Ge solubility, and, more
speciﬁcally, the Li+ occupancies and I−/S2−site disorder were
monitored. With increasing Ge content, a signiﬁcant change in
the activation barrier was observed, which coincides with an
increase of the I−/S2−site disorder. The structural changes and
increasing lattice volume lead to an opening of the bottle necks,
and nuclear magnetic resonance indicates more facile intercage
jumps The interpenetration of face-centered-cubic lattices in
the argyrodite structure means that only a low degree of disorder
is needed to reach the percolation threshold. The drop in the
activation barrier due to these structural changes leads to a high
ionic conductivity of 5.4 ± 0.8 mS cm−1 in Li6.6P0.4Ge0.6S5I, and
sintering of the pellets can further increase the ionic conductivity
to 18.4 ± 2.7 mS cm−1. With these high-performance solid
electrolytes solid-state batteries with thick electrode conﬁg-

fade over 150 cycles.
This work shows that structural changes and site disorder can
be used to induce severe changes in the potential energy
landscape. These structural changes strongly aﬀect the activation
barrier for the mobile ions, which helps to further optimize
electrolytes towards obtaining high ionic conductivities and
allows their practical use in thick-electrode cells for solid-state
battery applications.

BSTRACT: Solid-state batteries with inorganic solid electrolytes are
rrently being discussed as a more reliable and safer future alternative to
e current lithium-ion battery technology. To compete with state-of-thelithium-ion batteries, solid electrolytes with higher ionic conductivities
e needed, especially if thick electrode configurations are to be used. In the
arch for optimized ionic conductors, the lithium argyrodites have
racted a lot of interest. Here, we systematically explore the influence of
ovalent substitution in Li6+xP1−xGexS5I using a combination of X-ray and
utron diffraction, as well as impedance spectroscopy and nuclear
agnetic resonance. With increasing Ge content, an anion site disorder is
duced and the activation barrier for ionic motion drops significantly,
ding to the fastest lithium argyrodite so far with 5.4 ± 0.8 mS cm [−][1] in a
ld-pressed state and 18.4 ± 2.7 mS cm [−][1] upon sintering. These high
nic conductivities allow for successful implementation within a thick-electrode solid-state battery that shows negligible
pacity fade over 150 cycles. The observed changes in the activation barrier and changing site disorder provide an additional
proach toward designing better performing solid electrolytes.

NTRODUCTION


-state batteries provide a possibility for energy storage with
er energy densities and improved safety by using a solid
rolyte and lithium metal anode, as compared to using liquid
rolytes. [1][−][7] There have been many recent advances in the
concerning a better understanding of the interfacial
ions, [8][−][10] the employment of coatings, [11][,][12] the minimized
of carbon additives, [13][−][15] strain design and particle size
mization in the electrodes. [16][−][18] However, the challenge for
electrode configurations [19] still remains: the use of solid
rolytes in thick electrode configurations is currently limited
he low ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes. [2][,][19] Electrowith high ionic conductivities are needed to achieve higher
gy densities.
cently, among all of the well-performing lithium
phosphates, such as the Li2S−P2S5 glass phases and
MP2S12 (M = Ge, Sn), [20][−][29] the class of argyrodites
S5X (X = Cl, Br, I) has attracted considerable interest. [30][−][34]

crystal structure of Li6PS5X is shown in Figure 1. In a fully
red arrangement, the halide anions X [−] form a face-centered
c lattice (Wyckoff 4a) with PS43− tetrahedra on the

octahedral sites (P on Wyckoff 4b) and the free S [2][−] in half of
the tetrahedral sites (Wyckoff 4d). Diffusion in solid electrolytes
is usually analyzed in terms of jumps between individual sites. [35]

Crystallographic studies in the argyrodites have identified two
distinct Li [+] positions, namely, the 48h and 24g Wyckoff
positions, which form Li [+] cages around the free S [2][−] on Wyckoff
4d. Within a site-jump model of lithium diffusion there are three
inequivalent jumps: 48h−24g−48h (doublet jump), 48h−48h
within the cage (intracage jump), and 48h−48h between the
cages (intercage jump). [30][,][33] For X = Cl and Br the S [2][−] and X [−]
positions exhibit a significant fraction of anion site disorder. [32][−][34][,][36] If iodine is the halide in the structure, no site
disorder occurs due to the large size mismatch between S [2][−] and
I [−], [30] opening up the question as to whether the site disorder can
be influenced further. Kraft et al. have recently shown that the
absence of the disorder in the iodine-containing argyrodites is
associated with high activation barriers for ion migration and a
low ionic conductivity of 1.3 × 10 [−][6] S cm [−][1] . [30] While

itutions have been performed mostly on the anion sites in
rgyrodites, a recent study shows the possibility of aliovalent
ng in Li6+xP1−xSixS5Br, [31] producing an increase in the ionic
uctivity. It should be noted however that the incorporation
e [4+] in Li6PS5Br was not possible due to the larger ionic
s of Ge [4+] in the smaller lattice volume in Li6PS5Br.
spired by the possibility of incorporating Ge into a
position possessing a larger unit cell, we have investigated
effect of Ge [4+] substitution in Li6+xP1−xGexS5I on the
ture-transport relationships. Using a combination of
veld refinements against neutron and X-ray diffraction
we identify the underlying structural changes associated
the Li and anion substructures including changes to the site
der. Impedance spectroscopy and lithium nuclear magnetic
nance were used to monitor the changing ionic transport.

e activation barrier and an increase in the conductivity over
rs of magnitude, leading to the highest in lithium reported
r with σ = 5.4 ± 0.8 mS cm [−][1], when cold-pressed, and σ =
± 2.7 mS cm [−][1] upon sintering. We further show that this
onic conductor can be used to build solid-state batteries
thick anode and cathode layers, exhibiting stable capacities
at least 150 cycles, even at higher C-rates. This work
onstrates that inducing disorder in materials using
ental substitutions is a promising approach to alter the
ntial energy landscape tailoring the ionic conductivity of
electrolytes for better performing all-solid-state batteries.


XPERIMENTAL METHODS
nthesis. All preparations and sample treatments for
P1−xGexS5I were carried out under an argon atmosphere. Lithium
e (Li2S, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.98%), phosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5,
a-Aldrich, 99%), germanium sulfide (GeS, Alpha Aesar, 99.99%),
(S, Acros Organics, 99.999%), and LiI (Alpha Aesar, 99.995%)
mixed in the appropriate stoichiometric ratio. Before the synthesis,
ecursors were thoroughly dried and sulfur was sublimated. All
res were hand ground in an agate mortar, pressed into pellets, and
filled into quartz ampules (10 mm inner diameter and 10−12 cm
gth), which were sealed under vacuum. All ampules were carbond and preheated at 800 °C under dynamic vacuum to avoid all
of water in the reaction atmosphere. The reactions were



performed at 550 °C for 2 weeks in order to ensure a complete reaction.
The obtained mixture was subsequently ground and isostatically
pressed into pellets (10 mm diameter) for the impedance measurements or kept as powder for the diffraction studies.
Neutron Powder Diffraction. High-resolution neutron powder
diffraction data collection on the argyrodite samples Li6+xP1−xGexS5I
with x = 0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.3, and 0.6 was performed in a Debye−Scherrer
geometry at the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (research reactor FRM
II, Garching b. München, Germany) on the high-resolution
diffractometer SPODI. [37] Data collection was performed using one
wavelength, i.e., monochromatic neutrons (λ = 1.548 17(2) Å) that
were obtained from the thermal neutron beam at a 155° takeoff angle
using the 551 and 331 reflections of a vertically focused composite Ge
monochromator of 200 mm height. The vertical-position-sensitive
multidetector (300 mm vertical sensitivity range at 1.117 m sample-todetector distance) consisting of 80 [3] He tubes and covering an angular
range of 160° 2θ was used for data collection. The samples
(approximately 2 cm [3] in volume) were filled into a thin-wall (0.15
mm) vanadium can of 12 mm in diameter under an argon atmosphere
and then metal-sealed using indium wire. The vanadium container was
then mounted on a capillary spinner enabling sample rotation and, thus,
minimizing effects of preferred crystallite orientations. Two-dimensional powder diffraction data of the continuously rotated sample were
collected and corrected for geometrical aberrations and detector
nonlinearities. [38]

X-ray Powder Diffraction. X-ray diffraction measurements of
Li6+xP1−xGexS5I were carried out on a PANalytical Empyrean powder
diffractometer in Bragg−Brentano θ−θ geometry with Cu Kα radiation.
Measurements were carried out in the 2θ range between 10° and 90°
with a step size of 0.026°. The counting time per step was 300 s. All
powders were placed on (911)-oriented silicon zero background
holders and sealed using a 7.5 μm thick Kapton polyimide film.
Rietveld Analysis. Rietveld refinements were carried out using the
TOPAS-Academic V6 software package. [39] Similar to recent work on
Li10GeP2S12, [25] a 2θ range of 10−26.5° was excluded from the
refinements of X-ray diffractions in order to mitigate the interfering
diffraction intensity from the polyimide film background. The resultant
structural data obtained with excluding the lower 2θ range are in good
agreement with those from the neutron diffraction data over the whole
measured 2θ range. The peak profile shape was described by a pseudoVoigt function using the modified Thomson−Cox−Hastings setting. [40]

Fit indicators Rwp and Rexp and the goodness-of-fit S were used to assess
the quality of the refined structural models. [41] The following parameters
were initially refined: (1) scale factor, (2) 30 coefficients for a
Chebyshev background, (3) peak shape, (4) lattice parameters
including sample displacement, (5) fractional atomic coordinates, (6)
isotropic atomic displacement parameters. Finally (7), atomic
occupancies of the anions were then allowed to refine simultaneously
with all other parameters, to quantify the anion site disorder.
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. Electrical conductivities were measured by ac impedance spectroscopy, using pellets with
vapor-deposited gold layers. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) was conducted in the temperature range of −20 to 60 °C using a
VMP300 impedance analyzer (Bio-Logic Science Instruments) at
frequencies from 7 MHz to 100 mHz with an amplitude of 10 mV. All
fits were performed using the RelaxIS software package (rhd
Instruments, version 3).
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. Variable-temperature T1 and
quadrupolar echo experiments have been performed on a Bruker NMR
spectrometer operating at a lithium ( [7] Li) frequency of 77.8 MHz. All
experiments were performed in the static mode. Quadrupolar echo
experiments were acquired to estimate temperature-induced line
narrowing, which reports on the dynamics in kHz frequency range.
The pulse sequence consisted of two 90° pulses separated by a 30 μs
echo delay; after the second 30 μs echo delay acquisition started. Sixtyfour scans have been collected to obtain a spectrum at each
temperature, and a recycle delay of 5 s was found to be sufficient to
obtain full restoration of the initial spin state before each repetition.
Full-width at half-height (fwhh) has been used as a measure of motional
averaging of the “rigid” line width. For T1-relaxation time measure

ructural Characterization. The Li [+] superionic argyrs Li6+xP1−xGexS5I have been synthesized with increasing
/P [5+] ratios in order to study the structural changes and
s the effect of the increasing lithium content on the ionic

y form factor of Li [+], selected samples of x = 0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.3,
0.6 were also investigated using neutron diffraction to better
e the changing Li [+] substructure. These sample composiwere selected based on the occurring changes in the ionic

(x = 0.8) and the Ge occupancy (x = 0.7) is likely due to the
larger uncertainty on the refined occupancy coming from
overlapping reflections of the main phase with the Li4GeS4
impurity phase. While there seems to be a degree of uncertainty
on the exact solubility limit, full solid solutions of
Li6+xP1−xGexS5I can be synthesized up to a composition of at
least Li6.7P0.3Ge0.7S5I. Despite the solubility limit, the samples
with x = 0.8 are included in the following structural and
transport data, whenever applicable, to allow for a discussion
beyond the solubility limit in this material. In addition, in order
to allow for a better discussion of the data, all subsequent data
are shown against the refined Ge fraction xR, as obtained from
the neutron and X-ray diffraction data, respectively.
With increasing Ge [4+] occupancy on the (P/Ge)S43−
tetrahedra, the volumes of the tetrahedra increase due to the
larger ionic radius of Ge [4+] vs P [5+], i.e., 0.39 pm vs 0.19 pm, [43] in
the tetrahedral coordination (Figure 3c). Another structural
characteristic within the argyrodite structure is the possible site
disorder between the free S [2][−] anion located on Wyckoff 4d and
the halide anion I [−] on Wyckoff 4a. While Cl [−]   - and Br [−]   containing argyrodites show a high degree of anion site disorder,
in which the disorder decreases with increasing anionic size
mismatch, no disorder had been found for Li6PS5I due to the
large difference in ionic radii between I [−] and S [2][−] . [30] Figure 3d
shows the I [−] /S [2][−] site disorder, as obtained from the Rietveld
refinements against X-ray and neutron diffraction data. At a Ge
fraction of ∼20 at. % there is a clear onset of I [−] /S [2][−] site disorder,
reaching ∼7% around the solubility limit. Whether the changing
disorder occurs due to a larger unit cell after Ge [4+] substitution,
which allows for better mixing of the mismatched anions, or due
to the increasing Li [+] density in the structure remains unclear.
Within the series of solid solutions Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I), a
decreasing site disorder due to the incorporation of I [−] is
correlated to an increase in the activation barrier for the
migrating Li [+] cations, [30] as measured by impedance spectroscopy, and similar effects on the ionic transport may be expected
here.
In addition to the structural changes of the (Ge/P)S4
tetrahedra and I [−] /S [2][−] site disorder, the neutron diffraction
data allow the analysis of the changes in the Li [+] substructure
(Figure 4). With increasing Ge [4+] occupancy, the Li [+] occupancy
of the 24g site increases (Figure 4a), and essentially all additional
Li [+] occupies this site, similar to the behavior observed for the
incorporation of Si [4+] in Li6PS5Br. [31] The increasing Li occupancy
on the 24g site leads to the larger Coulombic repulsion, which
results in the longer doublet distance 48h−24g−48h, whereas a
minor decrease of the distance between the Li cages (i.e., the
intercage distance) can be found. Furthermore, with increasing
Li [+] and Ge [4+] content in the structure the tetrahedral volume of
Li(48h)S3I polyhedra and the area of the Li(24g)S3 triangular
plane increase. As the Li(48h)S3I polyhedra represent the
bottleneck for the rate-determining intercage jump, the wider
diffusion pathways for Li [+] in the structure may affect the
mobility of the moving cation.
Ionic Transport. Temperature-dependent impedance spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements were
performed to assess changes to the ionic conductivity. Arrhenius
plots of all samples of Li6+xP1−xGexS5I and their corresponding
impedance responses with the respective fits are shown in Figure
5. The impedance data were fit with an equivalent circuit
consisting of one parallel constant phase element (CPE)/
resistor in series with a CPE, representing the blocking

Figure 6 shows the ionic conductivities of Li6+xP1−xGexS5I, as
measured by impedance spectroscopy, as well as the extracted
activation barrier for Li [+] migration. With increasing fraction of
Ge [4+] and Li [+], the conductivity increases over 3 orders of
magnitude and reaches a maximum conductivity of σ = 5.4 ± 0.8
mS cm [−][1] for Li6.6P0.4Ge0.6S5I. As the observed increase in the
conductivity cannot be directly explained by the minor increase
in charge carrier density, the activation energy must be having a
tremendous influence. With increasing x, the activation barrier
remains constant at first and then significantly drops, showing an
inflection around xR = 0.25 that is responsible for the high ionic
conductivity in the Ge-substituted Li6+xP1−xGexS5I. Sintering of
the cold pressed pellets at 823 K for 10 min increases the
conductivity further to σ = 18.4 ± 2.7 mS cm [−][1], likely due to
better grain contact. The variance in the conductivity is
calculated from multiple measurements conducted with different measurement setups to corroborate these high conductivity
[values (see Supporting Information Figure S2).](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.8b10282/suppl_file/ja8b10282_si_001.pdf)
In addition to the impedance data, selected sample
compositions were investigated using 7Li nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy. Figure 7a shows changes of the signal
line width as a function of temperature for three measured
samples with the compositions of x = 0.0, 0.25, and 0.6 in
Li6+xP1−xGexS5I, chosen for their different activation barriers
(vide infra). Only Li6PS5I demonstrates significant dependence
of the signal width, whereas the fwhh for all other samples
appears to be rather small, even at the lowest available
temperatures. Line narrowing starts when the mobility of nuclei
in frequency units matches the line width in the rigid limit (a
plateau at very low temperatures). Thus, one can estimate the
activation energy and the speed of the local ionic motion. As a
low-temperature plateau is only observed in the Li6PS5I sample,
the Hendrickson−Bray approach [46] can be used to obtain
motional parameters in this composition. For the undoped
Li6PS5I this procedure gives an estimation of the activation
energy of 0.49 eV (Figure 7b). The frequency of the
corresponding motion can be extrapolated to room temperature
and is found to be 1 × 10 [6] s [−][1] . In contrast, samples with x = 0.25
and x = 0.6 undergo much faster motional processes, which
cannot be characterized with the current method. Therefore, T1
relaxation time studies (for more information see the of Nuclear
[Magnetic Resonance section in the Supporting Information) are](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.8b10282/suppl_file/ja8b10282_si_001.pdf)
employed to expand the sensitivity window of the dynamical
NMR to nanoseconds. The samples with x = 0 and x = 0.6 can be
accurately fitted with a single symmetric curve around the
maximum, indicating equal Ea values at high and low
temperatures. However, the sample with x = 0.25 reveals
different slopes for both flanks, which can be attributed to the
coexistence of two types of motion. The first one is activated at
lower temperatures and has an activation energy of ELTa = 0.11
eV, and another one appears at higher temperatures and is
characterized by EHTa = 0.21 eV. All T1-defined dynamical
[parameters and analysis procedures are listed in the Supporting](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.8b10282/suppl_file/ja8b10282_si_001.pdf)

Assuming that Li [+] transport consists of hops between welldefined crystallographic sites, there are three different jump
processes possible in Li6PS5X argyrodites, i.e., the doublet 48h
jumps, the intracage, and the intercage movements. Moreover,

(intracage jumps) and does not lead to long-range transfer of the
Li [+] ions. In contrast, the slower mobility, which becomes
apparent in motional narrowing experiments, is characterized by
a much higher activation energy and will be the limiting step in
the observable bulk transport, i.e., the intercage jump. The
Einstein−Smoluchowski and Nernst−Einstein equations can be
used to estimate the conductivity of the sample. [47][,][48] First, the
diffusion coefficient (D) is defined from the frequency of motion
(Kexchange) and the distance between Li sites dLi−Li as obtained
from the Rietveld refinement of neutron diffraction data:

uctivity increases over 3 orders of magnitude, reaching a
uctivity of σ = 5.4 mS cm [−][1] . An inflection point starting at
% Ge can be seen that leads to a strong decrease of the activation
er.


e all jumps are necessary for the long-range transport of Li [+]

33 intercage jumps have been proposed to be the ratermining step. Combining this knowledge with the results of
dynamical NMR studies, one can describe the motional
re in the Ge-doped samples. The undoped Li6PS5I
rgoes two different motional changes in the μs−ns time
. We suppose that the faster (visible in T1 relaxation)
sponds to the 48h−24g−48h (doublet jumps) or 48h−48h



where N is the charge carrier density approximated by the
number of Li [+] ions per unit cell, q is the charge of the charge
carriers, and T is the temperature. Based on these equations, a
conductivity of 2.6 × 10 [−][5] S cm [−][1] at room temperature can be
estimated for Li6PS5I, close to the ionic conductivity obtained
via impedance spectroscopy.
Although NMR on the sample Li6.25P0.75Ge0.25S5I also reveals
two separate processes, which are likewise described by different
activation energies, both modes are visible only in T1-relaxation
measurements, suggesting much faster rates than those existing
in the undoped sample. We propose that the mode with an
activation energy of 0.11 eV corresponds to small fluctuations
between 48h and 24g sites or the intracage jump process, and the
second process can be ascribed to intercage jumps. The sample
with a Ge content of 0.6 undergoes a single motional process in
the current time scale window with rather low activation energy,
in good agreement with the data from impedance spectroscopy.

uppose that this corresponds to intercage jumps, whereas
maller scale movements stay outside of the sensitivity
ow of the method. Using eqs 1 and 2, a conductivity of 3.9
m [−][1] can be estimated for x = 0.25 and 7.5 mS cm [−][1] for x =
in Li6+xP1−xGexS5I. Overall, the estimated Li-ion convities obtained here are in good agreement with the
uctivities measured via impedance spectroscopy, suggesthe reduction in the activation energy of the rate-limiting
cage jumps is key to the high conductivity. The slight
epancy in the conductivity obtained by impedance
roscopy can likely be attributed to the changing correlation
rs with changing Li [+] carrier density. [49][,][51]

ructure-Transport Correlation. The collected data on
liovalent substitution of Li6+xP1−xGexS5I show that simple
itutions can have a tremendous influence on the ionic
port in the argyrodite structure and that a high conductivity
e solid electrolytes can be obtained. Impedance spectrosand nuclear magnetic resonance data show a decrease in
ctivation barrier for ionic motion with the inflection point
nd xR = 0.25. In addition, the structural data obtained by



Rietveld refinements against neutron and X-ray diffraction data
show an increasing width of the diffusion pathway and an
increase in the I [−] /S [2][−] site disorder. In Figure 8a, the changing
activation barriers are shown together with the changing of I [−] /
S [2][−] site disorder on Wyckoff 4a. There is a clear correlation
between the onset of the site disorder and the drop in the
activation barrier. As recently theoretically suggested [33] and
experimentally corroborated, [30] disorder between the free sulfur
site (Wyckoff 4d) and the halide site (Wyckoff 4a) leads to lower
activation barriers. In Li6PS5Br1−xIx, Kraft et al. [30] were able to
show that a subsequent replacement of Br [−] with I [−] leads to fewer
halide anions on the free sulfur site and vice versa, resulting in an
increasing activation barrier for ionic motion. In this work, the
occurrence of disorder leads to a sharp decrease of the activation
barrier.
Despite the clear correlation between the disorder and the
decreasing activation barrier, it remains puzzling that such a
small degree of disorder can affect the transport so significantly.

electrode configurations necessary. [19] While the convity of the sintered Li6.6P0.4Ge0.6S5I is the highest Li [+]
uctivity reported in the argyrodites so far, solid-state
ries employing thiophosphates commonly use cold-pressed
rolytes, so this high conductivity value for the sintered

ode and anode composites. The cathode has an approximate

        Eﬀect of Si substitution on the structural and
transport properties of superionic Li-argyrodites†

*ab
Inspired by the recent interest in lithium ion conducting argyrodites as solid electrolytes for solid-state
batteries, we have investigated the inﬂuence of aliovalent substitution in Li6PS5Br. Using Rietveld
reﬁnements against X-ray and neutron diﬀraction, coupled with impedance spectroscopy, we monitor
the inﬂuence of Si4+ substitution for P5+ in Li6+xP1xSixS5Br on the structure and ionic transport
properties. A step-wise incorporation of Si4+ leads to an expansion of the unit cell, as well as the
inclusion of additional Li+ within the structure. The increasing Li content occupies the structural
transition state and, in combination with the structural changes, leads to a three-fold improvement of
the ionic conductivity. This work demonstrates that the argyrodite material class can be optimized
through aliovalent substitution, thereby making argyrodites an ideal system for studying solid electrolytes
within the ﬁeld of solid-state batteries.
1.
Introduction
Solid ion conductors (or solid electrolytes) have recently gained
renewed interest due to their possible use in solid-state
batteries. Using a fast Li+ conducting solid provides the possi-
bility to replace the ubiquitous liquid electrolytes, hopefully
leading to safer and more reliable batteries.1,2 Beyond oxide
materials, such as garnets and the NASICON phosphates,3–10 the
class of thiophosphates shows great promise. Due to the more
polarizable PS4
3 anion, these somaterials exhibit high
conductivities and low activation barriers, which are both
important prerequisites for solid-state battery applications.11–15
Despite the inherent instability of thiophosphates against Li
metal anodes,16–20 a multitude of materials are currently
garnering a lot of attention, such as Li10GeP2S12, Li3PS4,
Li7P3S11, thiophosphate glass ceramics and the argyrodites
Li6PS5X.14,21–39 However, a deeper understanding of the struc-
tural inuence on the ionic conductivity is still missing for
many materials.
Fig. 1 shows the unit cell of Li6PS5Br. In a fully ordered
structure, the Br anions form a face-centered cubic lattice (4a
Wyckoﬀposition) with PS4
3 polyhedra on the octahedral sites
(P on Wyckoﬀ4b) and S2 anions in half of the tetrahedral voids
on Wyckoﬀposition 4d (sometimes denoted as 4c, depending
on the choice of origin and setting).40 However, in the Br (and
Cl) containing Li6PS5X argyrodites, a signicant amount of site
disorder between Br and S2 has been found to exist and has
been shown to inuence the ionic transport.26,36,41,42 Regarding
the mobile ions, two Li+ positions are known and are located on
the 48h and 24g Wyckoﬀpositions. Here, the 24g position acts
as the transition state between jumps from 48h–48h. In the
composition Li6PS5Cl, the 48h position is occupied by exactly
50%, providing a vacant site on every next-neighbor position,
which indeed makes these materials superionic.43 However,
Kraet al.14 recently found a lower occupancy for the 48h
position in Li6PS5Br, with the residual Li+ residing on the 24g
transition state. Within the structure, the available Li+ positions
form cage-like local polyhedra for ion jumps that can be divided
into three possible jump processes (see Fig. 1b), in which the
site-disorder seems to positively aﬀect the jump rate of Li+ and
may even alter the rate-determining jump.14,36
While many Cu+ and Ag+ containing argyrodites have been
well studied from a structural point of view,44–48 not much is
known about the eﬀect of aliovalent doping within the argyr-
odite class. Aliovalent doping in superionic compounds is oen
used in order to increase the number of charge carriers, and
with it the ionic conductivity.6,35,49–52 However, most argyrodite
studies have so far focused on the isoelectronic substitution on
the anion position,14,26,33,36 leaving the question of the inuence
of more Li+ in the structure unanswered. In order to better

understand the eﬀect of aliovalent doping in Li+ conducting
argyrodites, the substitution of P5+ with Si4+ was performed in
the solid solutions Li6+xP1xSixS5X. By combining structural
characterizations, i.e. X-ray and neutron diﬀraction with elec-
trochemical impedance spectroscopy, we show the eﬀect of
increasing the Si4+ content on the ionic conductivity. While the
larger Si4+ increases the size of the unit cell, it also increases the
Li+ concentration and leads to a rising occupancy of Li+ on the
transition state for hopping. This additional Si4+ increases the
conductivity to greater than 2 mS cm1. This work shows the
applicability of aliovalent doping in the superionic argyrodites,
thereby demonstrating the optimization potential for this class
of materials.

Experimental methods
Synthesis
All preparations and sample treatments for Li6+xP1xSixS5X were
carried out under argon atmosphere. Lithium sulde (Li2S,
Sigma Aldrich, 99.98%), phosphorus pentasulde (P2S5, Sigma
Aldrich, 99%), as well as LiBr (ChemPur, 99.995%) and Si
(ChemPur, 99%) were mixed in the appropriate stoichiometric
ratio. All precursors were thoroughly dried using a vacuum oven
before usage. All mixtures were hand ground in an agate mortar,
pressed into pellets and then lled into quartz ampoules
(10 mm inner diameter and 10–12 cm in length), which were
sealed under vacuum. All ampoules were carbon-coated and
pre-heated at 800 C under dynamic vacuum to avoid all traces
of water in the reaction atmosphere. The reactions were per-
formed at 550 C for two weeks in order to ensure a complete-
ness of the reaction and phase purity. The obtained mixture was
subsequently ground and isostatically pressed into pellets
(10 mm diameter) for the electrochemical measurements or
kept as powder for the diﬀraction studies.

Structural investigations were carried out by means of X-ray

(PANalytical, Netherlands) with Cu Ka radiation (l1 ¼ 1.54051 ˚A,
l2 ¼ 1.54433 ˚A) in Bragg–Brentano q–q geometry and a PIXcel3D
area detector with 255 measuring channels. Samples were
pulverized and placed on (911)-oriented silicon zero back-
ground holders that were sealed with Kapton foil under argon
atmosphere. Patterns were collected in the range of 10–90 2q
with a step size of 0.026 and an exposure time of 100 s per step.
Neutron powder diﬀraction
High-resolution neutron powder diﬀraction data collection on
the argyrodite samples at room temperature was performed in
a Debye–Scherrer geometry at the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zen-
trum (research reactor FRM II, Garching b. M¨unchen, Germany)
on the high-resolution diﬀractometer SPODI.53 Data collection
using one wavelength was performed, i.e. monochromatic
neutrons (l ¼ 1.54817(2) ˚A), and were obtained from the
thermal neutron beam at a 155 take-oﬀangle using the (551)
reection of a vertically focused composite Ge monochromator
of 200 mm in height. The vertical position-sensitive multi-
detector (300 mm vertical sensitivity range at 1.117 m sample-
to-detector distance) consisting of 80 3He tubes and covering
an angular range of 160 2q was used for data collection. The
samples (approx. 2 cm3 in volume) were lled into thin-wall
(0.15 mm) vanadium cans of 12 mm in diameter under an
argon atmosphere and then metal-sealed using indium wire.
The vanadium container was then mounted on a capillary
spinner enabling sample rotation and thus, minimizing eﬀects
of preferred crystallite orientation. Two-dimensional powder
diﬀraction data of the continuously rotated sample were
collected
and
corrected
for
geometrical
aberrations
and
detector nonlinearities.54
Rietveld analysis
Rietveld renements were carried out using GSAS II soware.55
Fit indicators – Rwp, Rexp, and c2 – were used to assess the
quality of the rened structural models.56 The following

The (7) atomic occupancies of the anions were then allowed to
rene simultaneously with all other parameters, to quantify the
anion site disorder, while the Si occupancy was xed to the
nominal content. Moreover, in the X-ray diﬀraction data the Li
occupancies were xed to the values extracted from the neutron
renement of Li6PS5Br and the isotropic atomic displacement
parameters for Li were xed to 0.05. Finally, (8) phase fractions
and the associated lattice parameters of impurity phases were
rened. The neutron renements were conducted using the
same procedure with several exceptions: (i) the background
coeﬃcients were t using a Chebyschev function with 12
parameters and (ii) the Li occupancies and isotropic atomic
displacement parameters were allowed to rene. (iii) Additional
reections of the vanadium sample holder can be found in the
neutron diﬀraction patterns.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrical conductivities were measured by AC impedance
spectroscopy, using pellets (1.5 mm thickness, geometric
density of all samples 85%) with vapor deposited gold layers.
Electrochemical impedance analysis (EIS) was conducted in the
temperature range of 20 C to 60 C using a SP300 impedance
analyzer (Biologic) at frequencies from 7 MHz to 100 mHz with
an amplitude of 10 mV. All measurements were performed in
pouch cells under argon atmosphere.
Scanning electron microscopy
The microstructure of the electrolyte pellets was investigated
using the Carl Zeiss Ultra eld emission SEM instrument
Merlin. The air sensitive samples were transferred from the
glovebox to the vacuum chamber of the SEM with the Leica
3.
Results and discussion
Structural characterization
The Li+ superionic argyrodites Li6+xP1xSixS5Br have been
synthesized with increasing Si4+/P5+ ratios in order to study the
structural changes and the solubility limit of Si4+ in the struc-
ture, as well as to assess the eﬀect of the increasing lithium
content on the ionic conductivity. For the structural character-
ization, X-ray diﬀraction was performed on all samples. More-
over, due to the low X-ray form factor of Li+, selected samples of
(x ¼ 0, 0.125 and 0.25) were also investigated using neutron
diﬀraction to better probe the changing Li+ substructure.
Fig. 2 shows a representative Rietveld renement of an X-ray
and a neutron diﬀraction pattern of Li6.125P0.875Si0.125S5Br. All
samples exhibit minor impurity phase fractions of Li3OBr and
LiBr in the diﬀraction data for the series of solid solutions (see
ESI†). The samples seem to react with the ampoules leading to
an impurity phase fraction of 2.8 wt% Li3OBr in Li6.125P0.875-
Si0.125S5Br, despite the carbon coating and careful drying
procedure of the silica ampoules. The minor impurities are
unlikely to aﬀect the ionic transport14 and the obtained struc-
tural data of all solid solutions, obtained via Rietveld rene-
ment against laboratory X-ray and neutron diﬀraction patterns,
can be found tabulated in the ESI.†
Fig. 3 shows the structural data extracted from Rietveld
renements against the laboratory X-ray diﬀraction patterns.
With increasing Si4+ content, the lattice parameter of the cubic
structure increases linearly until it reaches a saturation level at
30 mol% (x ¼ 0.3) of Si4+ content. The increasing lattice
parameter arises from the larger ionic radius of Si4+ (26 pm,
tetrahedrally coordinated) on the 4b tetrahedral site, compared
to P5+ (17 pm, tetrahedrally coordinated).58 This saturation
suggests a solubility limit, aer which a higher content of x ¼
0.5 does not lead to a further increase in the lattice parameter.
With increasing x, an expanding MS4 (M ¼ P1xSix) polyhedral

P
fractional occupancies would unequivocally prove the site
tion data was not possible. However, the increasing polyhedral
volumes and lattice parameters suggest successful incorpora-
tion of Si4+ on the P5+ site. It should be mentioned that Ge4+
substitution for P5+ in Li6PS5Br was also attempted; however, no
lattice variations were observed, corroborating the negligible
solubility of Ge in Li6PS5Br. As mentioned above, the Br anions
should be crystallographically separated from the free S2
anions, however a signicant amount of site disorder is known
due to the similar ionic radii of the Br and S2 anions.58 Fig. 3c
shows the Br/S2 site disorder found in the series of solid
solutions, which does not appear to exhibit any major changes
with the addition of Si4+.
Fig. 4 shows the eﬀect of the Si substitution on the Li+ sub-
lattice in Li6+xP1xSixS5Br, as obtained from the Rietveld
renement of the neutron diﬀraction patterns. With increasing
nominal Si4+ content, the occupancy on the 24g Wyckoﬀposi-
tion increases, while the occupancy of 48h position seems to
remain constant (with a possible minor decline). It was recently
shown that tailoring the anion framework in Li6PS5X by tuning
the halide composition (i.e. from Cl to Br and nally to I), and
increasing the unit cell dimensions, changes the lithium
distribution over these two sites.14 Here, a similar variation is

expansion drives additional lithium cations to occupy the
transition state of the jump process, i.e. Wyckoﬀ24g. Impor-
tantly, besides the lithium occupancy, the jump distances of the
diﬀerent Li+ cations can further inuence the diﬀusion as
recently shown by Kraet al.14 While changing jump distances
were found when altering the anion framework, Fig. 4b shows
that the minor structural changes on the cation framework do
not signicantly aﬀect the Li+–Li+ jump distances.
Ionic transport
Temperature-dependent impedance spectroscopy was per-
formed on all samples to assess changes to the ionic
conductivity. Arrhenius plots of representative samples (x ¼ 0,
12.5, 25 and 50 are shown for clarity), and the corresponding
impedance responses, are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively.
An exemplary t of the impedance data can be found in Fig. 5c.
All impedance data were t with an equivalent circuit con-
sisting of one parallel CPE/resistor in series with a CPE, rep-
resenting blocking electrodes. It should be noted that, due to
the low reliability of high frequency data for such fast-ionic
conductors, all ts were performed up to a maximum AC
frequency of 1 MHz. All impedance spectra exhibit a-values of
0.9, representing the ideality of the CPE,59 and geometric
capacitances around 0.1 nF cm2. Additionally, while bulk
and grain boundary contributions cannot be de-convoluted,
the obtained ideality of the semi-circle and capacitances, as
well as the high pellet densities (see scanning electron
micrograph
in
the
ESI†),
correspond
well
with
bulk
transport.60
As seen in Fig. 5b, the impedance of the materials decreases
with
increasing
Si4+
content,
which
corresponds
to
an
increasing
bulk
conductivity.
Accordingly,
the
room-
temperature ionic conductivities of Li6+xP1xSixS5Br are shown
in Fig. 6a. With increasing Si4+ content, the amount of Li+
increases and a three-fold increase in the conductivity from 0.7
mS cm1 for the unsubstituted sample to 2.4 mS cm1 for
Li6.35P0.65Si0.35S5Br can be observed. As the Si4+ content is
increased further, the conductivity slightly decreases, possibly
due to the solubility limit of Si4+ being surpassed and the
associated phase segregations. However, the change in carrier
density is very small, even for the 30 mol% Si4+ composition.
Indeed, a 5% increase in the lithium concentration cannot
account for a three-fold increase in the conductivity.
The Arrhenius data also provide information on the activa-
tion barrier for migration (Fig. 6b). Within the uncertainty in
the investigated temperature range, no major changes to the
activation energy EA can be seen, even though a changing unit
cell size and varying polyhedral volumes are known to aﬀect the
conductivity in ionic conductors.10,14 Given that the here-seen
changes in the polyhedral volumes are small, it may be
possible that the changes in the conductivity may also be
related to an additional underlying process. Notably, there are
no signicant variations in the site-disorder (see Fig. 3c) that

reason for the increase in the ionic conductivity may be
enhanced Li+–Li+ correlation upon adding more Li+ into the 24g
site, as seen in the neutron diﬀraction data. The increasing
population, and with it the coulombic repulsion, may lead to
a correlated motion of ions, as opposed to single unrelated ion
jumps. It has recently been shown that correlated motion of
ions can benecially aﬀect the ionic conductivity by changing
the Haven ratio, and with it the pre-factor, and even the acti-
vation barrier for hopping.11 However, a combination of theo-
retical
calculations,

modelling, as well as Li+ nuclear magnetic resonance experi-
ments are necessary to conrm the existence of correlated
motion in highly doped argyrodite superionics. Nevertheless,
these data show that aliovalent substitution toward the opti-
mization of the ionic conductivity in argyrodite superioncs is
possible, though more theoretical work is necessary to fully
understand the Li+ motion and Li+ interactions in this class of
materials.

Conclusion
In this work, the eﬀect of Si4+ substitution for P5+ in Li6+xP1x-
SixS5Br has been investigated as a function of Si4+ content.
Using a combination of X-ray diﬀraction, neutron diﬀraction
and impedance spectroscopy, it is possible to probe the resul-
tant structural changes and elucidate the structure–property
relationships within Li-argyrodites when aliovalent substitu-
tions are performed.
With increasing Si4+ substitution into the structure the
lattice parameters increase up to a solubility limit and a three-
fold increase in the ionic conductivity can be observed. The
structural data show that Si4+ incorporation increases the
carrier concentration and polyhedral volumes, while adding
more lithium cations into the transition state of hopping.
Ultimately, the combination of a changing structure, elevated
lithium content and enriched ion interactions lead to an
increase
in
the
conductivity,
thereby
corroborating
that
improvements to the ionic transport in the class of argyrodites

### Effect of Si substitution on the structural and transport properties of superionic Li-argyrodites

and Wolfgang G. Zeier - [ab]


Inspired by the recent interest in lithium ion conducting argyrodites as solid electrolytes for solid
batteries, we have investigated the influence of aliovalent substitution in Li6PS5Br. Using Rie

refinements against X-ray and neutron diffraction, coupled with impedance spectroscopy, we mo

the influence of Si [4+] substitution for P [5+] in Li6+xP1�xSixS5Br on the structure and ionic trans

properties. A step-wise incorporation of Si [4+] leads to an expansion of the unit cell, as well as

inclusion of additional Li [+] within the structure. The increasing Li content occupies the struc


transition state and, in combination with the structural changes, leads to a three-fold improveme


the ionic conductivity. This work demonstrates that the argyrodite material class can be optim

through aliovalent substitution, thereby making argyrodites an ideal system for studying solid electro

within the field of solid-state batteries.



conductors (or solid electrolytes) have recently gained
interest due to their possible use in solid-state
Using a fast Li [+] conducting solid provides the possireplace the ubiquitous liquid electrolytes, hopefully

 - safer and more reliable batteries. [1,2] Beyond oxide
, such as garnets and the NASICON phosphates, [3][–][10] the
hiophosphates shows great promise. Due to the more
le PS43� anion, these so materials exhibit high
vities and low activation barriers, which are both
t prerequisites for solid-state battery applications. [11][–][15]

nodes, [16][–][20] a multitude of materials are currently

disorder between Br [�] and S [2][�] has been found to exist and
been shown to inuence the ionic transport. [26,36,41,42] Regard
the mobile ions, two Li [+] positions are known and are locate
the 48h and 24g Wyckoff positions. Here, the 24g position
as the transition state between jumps from 48h–48h. In
composition Li6PS5Cl, the 48h position is occupied by exa
50%, providing a vacant site on every next-neighbor posit
which indeed makes these materials superionic. [43] Howe
Kra et al. [14] recently found a lower occupancy for the
position in Li6PS5Br, with the residual Li [+] residing on the
transition state. Within the structure, the available Li [+] posit
form cage-like local polyhedra for ion jumps that can be div
into three possible jump processes (see Fig. 1b), in which
site-disorder seems to positively affect the jump rate of Li [+]

may even alter the rate-determining jump. [14,36]

used in order to increase the number of charge carriers,

studies have so far focused on the isoelectronic substitution

nd the effect of aliovalent doping in Li [+] conducting
es, the substitution of P [5+] with Si [4+] was performed in
solutions Li6+xP1�xSixS5X. By combining structural
izations, i.e. X-ray and neutron diffraction with eleccal impedance spectroscopy, we show the effect of
g the Si [4+] content on the ionic conductivity. While the
+ increases the size of the unit cell, it also increases the
ntration and leads to a rising occupancy of Li [+] on the
n state for hopping. This additional Si [4+] increases the
vity to greater than 2 mS cm [�][1] . This work shows the
lity of aliovalent doping in the superionic argyrodites,
emonstrating the optimization potential for this class
als.

#### xperimental methods


rations and sample treatments for Li6+xP1�xSixS5X were
ut under argon atmosphere. Lithium sulde (Li2S,
drich, 99.98%), phosphorus pentasulde (P2S5, Sigma
99%), as well as LiBr (ChemPur, 99.995%) and Si
r, 99%) were mixed in the appropriate stoichiometric

into pellets and then lled into quartz ampoules

d at 800 [�] C under dynamic vacuum to avoid all traces
in the reaction atmosphere. The reactions were pert 550 [�] C for two weeks in order to ensure a completee reaction and phase purity. The obtained mixture was
ntly ground and isostatically pressed into pellets

Structural characterization

The Li [+] superionic argyrodites Li6+xP1�xSixS5Br have b
synthesized with increasing Si [4+] /P [5+] ratios in order to study
structural changes and the solubility limit of Si [4+] in the st
ture, as well as to assess the effect of the increasing lith
content on the ionic conductivity. For the structural chara
ization, X-ray diffraction was performed on all samples. M
over, due to the low X-ray form factor of Li [+], selected sample
(x ¼ 0, 0.125 and 0.25) were also investigated using neu
diffraction to better probe the changing Li [+] substructure.

substitution for P [5+] in Li6PS5Br was also attempted; however
lattice variations were observed, corroborating the neglig
